"""Check the external URLs written in the repository's Markdown.

`check_doc_links.py` deliberately stops at the edge of the repository: it
verifies local files and `#anchors` and skips anything starting with
`http`. That keeps the gate offline, which this project promises in several
places — but it also means nothing notices when an external reference rots.
A publisher reorganises its site, an Actions run is deleted, and the README
keeps pointing at it.

This script is the other half, and it is the only thing in the repository
that reaches the network on purpose. Three consequences, all deliberate:

* It is **not** part of `tests.yml`. A third-party outage must never turn a
  push red, so the offline gate stays offline and this runs on a schedule
  (`.github/workflows/links-external.yml`) or on demand.
* Every URL is classified. Two classes fail the run: a link that is gone
  (404/410, or a host that no longer resolves) and one whose status could not
  be determined (403, 429, 5xx, timeout). The second class can be accepted
  through `external_links_allowlist.txt`, one host per line with a reason —
  a host that refuses automated clients is a fact about that host, not about
  the document.
* Nothing here is trusted by the test suite, and no test reaches the network:
  `tests/test_external_links.py` drives the classification with a fake fetcher.

What it deliberately does not check
-----------------------------------
- URLs inside fenced code blocks or inline code. Two of them here are meant
  to be unreachable: `http://127.0.0.1:9` (the dead proxy in the offline
  proof) and `https://example.com`. Checking them would fail documentation
  that is correct.
- Loopback and `example.*` hosts anywhere, for the same reason.
- Whether the page still *says* what the document claims. This proves the
  reference resolves, not that it is still the right reference.
- `#fragments` on external URLs: verifying those means downloading and
  parsing every target, and a moved heading is not worth a weekly crawl.

Run it from anywhere:

    python3 tools/check_external_links.py [--verbose]

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 at least one failure, 2 unusable arguments.
