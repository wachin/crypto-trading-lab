# AGENT-HANDOFF.md — Continuation Guide

**Purpose:** everything a new AI Agent needs to continue this project from
its current state: what exists, what is verified, and where development
left off. The historical migration notes are kept in §3–§4 because they
still explain *why* the working rules exist.

A new AI Agent must read this file **before** doing anything else, then
`AGENTS.md`, then `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## 1. Project state (last updated 2026-10-28)

- **Repository:** `https://github.com/wachin/crypto-trading-lab`
  (branch `main`)
- **State verified at commit:** the commit that carries this file.
- **Tests:** 894 passed, 2 skipped, **exit code 0** —
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
  (The exit code matters: the suite used to segfault while the interpreter
  shut down, so it printed "passed" and still failed the build. See §5.)
- **CI:** `tests` is **green on `main`** — the run for the commit that carries
  this file reports 894/2 on `ubuntu-24.04` with pip and carries **no
  annotations**; the history is at
  [actions/workflows/tests.yml](https://github.com/wachin/crypto-trading-lab/actions/workflows/tests.yml).
  The first green run was `38777456963` (2026-10-15); the suite had never
  passed before it. Do not let a push go red without reading the log.
- **Verified platforms:** Debian 13 (system packages, Python 3.13.5) and
  **Windows 10** (pip/PyPI, Python 3.14.7, 2026-10-01 — clean install, the
  window opens, identical numbers, `ccxt` reaches the network).
- **macOS — deferred by the maintainer's decision, not a pending task.** It
  comes last, once the program works on Linux and Windows. Do not spend a
  session on it and do not treat a macOS failure as a blocker. The steps are
  prepared in `README.md` and `docs/en/developers/venv-setup.md`; the
  manual `cross-platform` workflow can measure it when its turn arrives.
- **Source:** 115 Python files under `src/crypto_trading_lab/`
- **Tests:** 64 test modules under `tests/`
- **Documentation:** `docs/en/beginners/` and
  `docs/en/developers/` (virtualenv guide in `venv-setup.md`, audit in
  `unwired-modules-audit.md`)
- **Verification kit:** the `Experiments/` kit was deleted on 2026-10-16
  (commit `b296785`); `requirements-all.txt` at the repository root and the
  manual `cross-platform` workflow now carry what it did.
- **Specification:** `ROADMAP.md` — 80 chapters in 16 parts
- **Git submodules:** 8 *optional* reference projects under `external/`.
  **A fresh clone creates `external/` as eight empty placeholder directories
  (git does that for submodules); they hold no files and you do not need to
  populate them** — the application builds and tests without them (both CI
  workflows pass `submodules: false`). **All eight are studied**: chapter 25
  is `[x]` and the conclusions are in `reference-projects.md` Parts A–H. Read
  that document; go to a repository only to re-verify a specific claim, and
  fetch that one alone (`git submodule update --init external/<name>`). Never
  `--recursive` by reflex: it downloads 12 GB, 8.5 GB of it `ccxt`. If you do
  fetch them and want the space back, the tested procedure is in that
  document under "Disk cost, and what can now be removed".
- **Current phase:** the scientific engine is mature. The 2026-09/10 review
  fixed the documentation-vs-code drift and cleared all 16 unwired modules
  found in the audit; the last one, `strategy_registry`, was wired into the
  Lab and the CLI on 2026-10-07 and then re-reviewed, which exposed three
  further defects in it (see `unwired-modules-audit.md` item 16). The
  frontier now is the live-data path (Binance WebSocket, chapters 26.2/27),
  testnet order placement (chapter 68) and packaging (chapters 15/16/18).
  Chapter 22 (the CLI) was completed on 2026-10-26: every subcommand now
  calls the shared use-case layer in `application.py`, so the CLI and the
  GUI cannot diverge (§5.2 item 1). Chapter 56.5 was completed on
  2026-10-28: the chapter 56 execution model now feeds the backtest engine
  and the robustness report, not only paper trading (§5.2 item 2). Chapter
  63.2 (drift reporting) was completed on 2026-10-28 as well (§5.2 item 3):
  expected ranges, drift over time, likely causes and a
  healthy/suspicious/degraded verdict. Chapters 26.2/27 were completed the
  same day (§5.2 item 4): the Binance WebSocket client is a real feed and
  `paper-live` runs a bounded session over it.
  **Real trading remains disabled by default.**

### What changed on 2026-09-19 (direction correction + Fase A/B)

The previous session had drifted: commits announced features that were
only unused imports or canned text. Those were fixed and backed by real,
tested code:

- `MainWindow._open_notebook` used to crash (`ExperimentManager` has no
  `list_experiments`); the manager now really has it, with persistence,
  statuses, tags, search and comparison.
- The research assistant no longer ignores the question and returns
  canned text: it is an honest, offline methodology assistant with an
  injectable model backend and persisted conversations.
- `run_optimization` passed arguments in the wrong order and swallowed
  the error, reporting “0 combinations tested”; fixed and tested.
- `RobustnessReport.summary()` raised `ValueError` (invalid f-string);
  fixed with a regression test.
- `strategy_builder.py` imported a non-existent `IndicatorFactory`, so
  the module could not be imported; fixed.
- New: historical-data download + validation + versioned datasets
  (`market_data/historical.py`, `persistence/datasets.py`), a research
  workflow service (`research.py`), the Research Wizard, validity
  dashboard, Research Notebook UI and strategy-builder UI, all i18n.
- Round 1 also found and fixed: the Learning Center crashed on lesson
  click (`Qt.AlignHCenter`) and on the quiz (`QHBoxBoxLayout`, always
  returned False, progress never loaded); and the strategy-builder
  module was unimportable while its launcher opened the dialog twice.
- New in round 1: a 48-lesson curriculum in three levels
  (`education/curriculum.py`), a rewritten Learning Center with a working
  quiz and persisted progress, executable rule strategies
  (`rule_strategy.py`) wired into the Backtesting Lab, and paper trading
  with a mandatory risk gate and a trading journal (`paper_session.py`,
  `ui/paper/paper_trading.py`).

### Contributor infrastructure

The repository is now prepared for outside contributors who work with AI
agents:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — setup, workflow, definition of done, the
  non-negotiable rules, a ready-to-paste agent prompt and a list of good
  first contributions.
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` — runs the offline suite on Debian
  packages (no pip, no venv) for every push and pull request.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` —
  they require the real test output and the owning ROADMAP chapter.
- `Makefile` — `make test`, `make run`, `make banner`, `make translations`.
- `tools/make_banner_gif.py` — regenerates the README contributor banner
  (deterministic; needs Pillow/NumPy only to regenerate the asset).
- `assets/contributing-agents.gif` — the animated banner (76 KB).

### Domain-model naming and the chapter 7/26/30 reconciliation

- `Symbol` is the validated trading-pair type (`BASE/QUOTE`): where chapter 7
  lists "TradingPair", the implementation is `Symbol`.
- Domain models implemented: `Market`, `Ticker`, `Candle`, `Balance`,
  `OrderRequest`, `Fill`, `OrderResult` (`domain/models.py`), plus
  `BacktestConfig`, `CostModel`, `TradeRecord`, `BacktestResult`
  (`backtesting/engine.py`). All money, price, quantity, fee and balance
  fields are `Decimal`; timestamps are UTC and naive ones are rejected.
- Domain models still to add (chapter 7): Exchange, Asset, Trade, OrderBook,
  OrderBookLevel, Position, Portfolio, Order, Fee, StrategySignal,
  RiskDecision, Backtest, PaperAccount, PerformanceMetrics, DatasetVersion,
  Experiment, StrategyVersion, QualificationReport.
- Chapter 30 is only partly done: `Market` carries `min_quantity`,
  `min_notional`, `price_precision`, `quantity_precision` and maker/taker fees,
  and `ExchangeAdapter.validate_order_request` performs the shared pre-flight
  checks. Still pending: true tick-size/step-size rules, rate limits, time
  synchronisation, and the remaining pre-trade steps (risk limits, data
  freshness, duplicate prevention, idempotency identifiers, beginner-readable
  rejections).
- Chapters 26.2 and 26.3 are partial: only the Binance endpoint configuration
  exists (centralised, spot-only, tested). There is no WebSocket layer, no
  reconnection logic and no Coinbase support.

### Development environment

- Python 3.13.5, Debian 13 (trixie), PyQt6 (system), pyqtgraph 0.13.7
  (system, installed via `python3-pyqtgraph`), SQLAlchemy 2.0.40,
  platformdirs 4.3.7, pytest 8.3.5, Qt tools `pylupdate6`/`lrelease`/
  `linguist` — **all from Debian packages, no venv needed**
- **A local `.venv/` (gitignored) exists for the PyPI path.** It was built on
  2026-10-26 from `requirements-all.txt` and measured in
  `docs/en/developers/venv-setup.md` §8 (PyYAML 6.0.3, PyQt6 6.11.0,
  pytest 9.1.1, same 807/2 result). The Debian packages stay the supported
  default; use the venv only to reproduce the pip path.

### One reference you will not have

The previous developer held the book's *exhibit compilation* as a local PDF.
It is git-ignored, was deliberately deleted and is **not part of the
repository**. This is not a blocker: every technique that depended on it is
already specified in `docs/en/developers/afml-techniques.md`, with the
exhibit numbers, the equations and the primary-paper citations in its §5.
Work from that specification; do not try to obtain the PDF.

## About the book — Marcos López de Prado, *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (Wiley, 2018)

Credit appears (and must be preserved) in:

- `docs/en/developers/reference-projects.md` — header and throughout
- `ROADMAP.md` — the "Vision and mission" section cites the book as
  the project's methodological reference
- `README.md` — "The method follows *Advances in Financial Machine
  Learning* (Marcos López de Prado)."

**Rule for the new repository:** the book is cited by bibliographic
reference only. Techniques from the book are implemented from the public
MIT-licensed exercise repository (`external/adv-financial-ml-marcos-
exercises`, already a submodule), from the book's own exhibit
compilation (a local reference copy, inventoried in
`reference-projects.md` A.9), and from the mathematical definitions
recorded in `docs/en/developers/afml-techniques.md`, always with
attribution. Never copy book text or code, and never commit the book —
printed text or exhibit compilation.

## 2. What to do if the Agent needs AFML material later

Part VIII of the ROADMAP (chapters 47-50) draws on the book. The new
repository's Agent must:

1. Read `docs/en/developers/afml-techniques.md` first — it holds the
   project's own specification of every AFML technique: purpose,
   mandatory parameters, algorithm outline, required tests, exhibit
   pointers and open questions.
2. Use `docs/en/developers/reference-projects.md` — Part A maps every
   relevant technique to roadmap sections with adoption guidance; A.9
   inventories the book's exhibit compilation (a local reference copy).
3. Use the MIT-licensed exercises submodule for reference code. For the
   snippets and equations the submodule lacks (sample weights, fractional
   differentiation, bet sizing, structural breaks, entropy, the PSR/DSR
   formulas, CPCV), use the specification in `afml-techniques.md` — it
   carries the exhibit numbers and equations, and the compilation itself
   is not available to you (see §1).
4. Implement from the recorded definitions, cite the book in
   docstrings/docs: *"Technique from López de Prado (2018),
   Advances in Financial Machine Learning, ch. N"*
5. Resolve every *open question* in `afml-techniques.md` before coding
   the affected technique. The two that were open (PBO/CSCV, ch. 49.6;
   the Deflated Sharpe Ratio, ch. 49.5) are now specified from their
   public primary papers, as the roadmap allows ("additional research",
   Ch. 49); only the DSR paper's Appendix 3 (effective number of
   independent trials) remains, with a conservative fallback. Never
   guess.
6. Never copy book text or code into the repository and never commit the
   book (printed text or exhibit compilation).

## 3. AGENTS.md at the repository root

The repository carries an `AGENTS.md` at its root so any
AI Agent (opencode, Codex, etc.) automatically loads the ground
rules. Keep it in sync with §4 of this file (the working rules) and with
the AFML book rule (§1).

## 4. Working rules (canonical)

These rules are canonical. Every Agent working here inherits them:

1. **Read `ROADMAP.md` first**; treat it as the specification. Never
   silently simplify or omit its requirements.
2. **MANDATORY STOP RULE for dependencies** (chapter 4.0 and
   `AGENTS.md` rule 2): if a new dependency is needed, STOP, notify the
   developer with package name, source (Debian/PyPI), reason, and exact
   command. Debian package → developer runs `apt install`. PyPI-only →
   the developer creates a venv (`.venv`), the Agent never installs or
   creates environments itself. The four required runtime dependencies
   come from Debian system packages; the optional extras (`ccxt`,
   `pypdf`, `keyring`, `aiohttp`, `websockets`) are PyPI-only.
3. **No real credentials**, no `eval()`/`exec()`, real trading stays
   disabled, strategies never bypass the risk manager.
4. **Vision and mission** (see ROADMAP.md intro): survive → validate
   → earn. Never risk money needed to live. Honest metrics only;
   never promise profits. The developer's economic situation makes
   capital protection a survival requirement, not ideology.
5. **Working method** (chapter 70): small changes, tests always run,
   results shown honestly, documentation evolves with code, English
   first (Spanish via Qt Linguist).
6. **Book rule** (§1 and §2 of this file): cite López de Prado by
   reference; never redistribute his text.
7. **Windows/portability**: code is Qt/stdlib/Debian-packages pure —
   keep it platform-neutral by construction, but Debian is the only
   officially supported target for now.

## 5. Where the project stands, and how to pick up work

### 5.1 The 2026-09/10 review (what changed, and why)

A repository review fixed one systematic problem: the documentation claimed
features the code did not ship. Concretely:

- **All 16 unwired modules were audited one by one.** The decisions and their
  evidence are in `docs/en/developers/unwired-modules-audit.md`: nine were
  deleted (dead, duplicated or non-functional), seven were merged or wired.
  The last of them, `strategy_registry.py`, was wired on 2026-10-07 by a
  contributing agent and then re-reviewed; the review found and fixed three
  more defects in it (a write to the current working directory on
  construction, a `_load()` that was never called, and a rule-7 regression
  in the new combo labels), plus a `strategy=None` path in the Lab.
- **The documented test baseline was wrong in twelve places** and had
  drifted between 229 and 698. It was `707 passed, 2 skipped` after that
  review, and the suite **exits 0**. The chapter 22 CLI work on 2026-10-26
  added 44 tests, so the current baseline is `807 passed, 2 skipped`.
- **The suite used to segfault while the interpreter shut down** (chapter 68
  imported Qt and re-initialised a `QObject`), so `make test` and CI failed
  while printing "passed". Fixed, with a regression test that forbids Qt in
  that module.
- **Chapter 56 execution realism is wired into paper trading**; chapter 63
  drift is shown in the Paper Trading screen; chapter 53 reproducibility now
  records the environment and the code hash; chapter 72 ethics guards report
  generation and the PDF export works; chapter 60 gained Kelly position
  sizing.
- **The CI was red for a real reason**: `ubuntu-24.04` ships SQLAlchemy 1.4
  and the code needs 2.0. `tests.yml` now installs with pip, and the manual
  `cross-platform` workflow runs Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
- **The default CI is green for the first time.** Run
  [38772811163](https://github.com/wachin/crypto-trading-lab/actions/runs/38772811163)
  (commit `7eecb0c`) was the first pass; run
  [38777456963](https://github.com/wachin/crypto-trading-lab/actions/runs/38777456963)
  (commit `4926437`) repeats it with `707 passed, 2 skipped` in 45.8 s on
  `ubuntu-24.04`, SQLAlchemy 2.1.4 and pypdf installed — the same numbers as
  Debian. The two skips are the intentional "adapter under test has trading
  enabled" guards, not missing dependencies.
- **The workflow actions are on Node 24** (`actions/checkout@v5`,
  `actions/setup-python@v6`). GitHub had begun force-running the old
  `@v4`/`@v5` on Node 24 and annotating the run about the deprecation; the
  bump was verified by run 38777456963, which reports no annotations. Do not
  pin them back down.
- **Windows 10 is verified** (measured 2026-10-01; see README "What is
  verified"). **macOS is deferred to the end of development by the
  maintainer's decision** — see §1.

### 5.2 The backlog, in the order that makes sense

1. ~~**The CLI subcommands that only pretend to work.**~~ **DONE
   2026-10-26.** Chapter 22 is `[x]`. Every subcommand now calls
   `src/crypto_trading_lab/application.py` (the same use cases the GUI
   uses): `database check` runs SQLite's `PRAGMA integrity_check` and
   reports real row counts, `import-csv` validates before writing,
   `backtest` runs the engine and metric catalogue from a JSON/YAML
   configuration, `glossary search` parses the beginner glossary, and
   `list-lessons` reads the curriculum. `doctor` now performs all twelve
   chapter 22 checks (connectivity and clock drift behind `--network`).
   A missing database is reported as missing, and no command returns `0`
   for work it did not do. The installed console script also dispatches
   correctly now: it used to point at the GUI function, so
   `crypto-trading-lab doctor` opened a window and ignored its arguments.
   Tests: `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_application.py`;
   documentation: `docs/en/developers/cli.md`. YAML configurations read
   through PyYAML: `debian/control` depends on `python3-yaml`, and
   `requirements-all.txt` plus the `yaml` extra cover pip installs.
2. ~~**Chapter 56.5** — feed the execution model into the **backtest
   engine** and robustness, not only paper trading.~~ **DONE 2026-10-28.**
   Chapter 56 is `[x]`. `BacktestConfig.execution_config` selects the model
   (and `execution_seed` makes it reproducible); with it set, the engine
   fills from a synthetic book whose depth is the traded volume *before*
   the fill candle, so oversized orders fill in part and orders with no
   depth are rejected instead of assumed away. `run_backtest` records the
   model and the seed in `config_metadata`, and the CLI names the model and
   reports rejections and partial fills. In robustness, `sweep_costs` now
   scales the model's own slippage assumptions (it used to drop the
   execution config and `position_fraction`), and `compare_execution_models`
   adds an `execution_impact` section to every `RobustnessReport`. Note the
   direction: the cost model applies a fixed adverse slippage while
   chapter 56 draws from a symmetric band, so the realistic arm can come
   out cheaper — the report says so instead of implying safety. The
   cost-model path is numerically unchanged. Tests:
   `tests/backtesting/test_execution_in_backtest.py`, plus 8 new cases in
   `tests/backtesting/test_robustness.py` and `tests/test_cli.py`.
3. ~~**Chapter 63.2** — drift over time, likely causes, and marking a
   strategy as degraded.~~ **DONE 2026-10-28.** `expected_ranges()` gives the
   band a live run should stay inside (trade bootstrap for return, anchored
   on the observed drawdown with a 1.5x tolerance for drawdown, because
   resampling trades cannot see intra-trade drawdown), `drift_over_time()`
   splits both equity curves into slices, and `assess_drift()` returns a
   `StrategyHealth` (healthy / suspicious / degraded) with the reasons, the
   causes and the evidence. The Paper Trading screen renders it. Chapter 63
   stays `[~]` for two reasons that are *not* this item: "live behavior"
   needs live trading (chapter 68), and 63.3 (the education text) is still
   open. Tests: 12 new cases in `tests/test_live_vs_backtest.py`; documented
   in `docs/en/developers/live-vs-backtest-drift.md`.
4. ~~**Chapters 26.2/27** — a continuous Binance WebSocket feed.~~ **DONE
   2026-10-28.** The client had five real defects, all fixed: `start()`
   blocked forever; staleness was only checked after a message arrived;
   renewal logged a line and kept the dead socket; dedup keyed on event time
   across streams; tickers were never dispatched. `run_paper_session_live()`
   now runs a bounded session, writes nothing to the working directory, keeps
   the caller's config, and refuses to evaluate a signal while the feed is
   DEGRADED. `crypto-trading-lab paper-live` exposes it, and a session too
   short to warm the strategy up now says so (`warmup_candles` on the
   strategy, a `Warm-up:` line in the output and a sentence in the note)
   instead of leaving an empty journal looking like a flat market. The same
   day, `paper-live` and the Historical Data screen were opened to every
   interval Binance serves (`1s` included); `1M` needed a calendar-based
   validator, which `CALENDAR_INTERVALS` now selects. That work exposed a
   chapter 40 defect: annualization assumed 365 periods per year for every
   interval. `BacktestResult.interval` now records the interval and
   `MetricConfig.for_interval` derives the periods from it. The review
   that followed added the other half: `min_span_days` (30) gates
   Sharpe/Sortino validity on market time, not just row count, and
   `ExperimentRecord.metric_config` stores the assumptions with the
   metrics so a saved Sharpe stays readable at the interval it used. The
   two test-only helpers from that review are fixed as well:
   `probabilistic_sharpe_ratio` de-annualizes before meeting its
   per-candle sample size, and `compute_portfolio_metrics` takes
   `periods_per_year`, compounds, and measures drawdown on the curve.
   Chapter 27 is `[x]`
   (the troubleshooting links pointed at a file that did not exist; it now
   exists and a test resolves every link and anchor). Chapter 26 stays `[~]`
   for 26.1 "demonstrations" and 26.3 Coinbase, neither of which this task
   covered. **Next task: chapters 15/16/18 (packaging).**

   *Known limitation, stated so nobody is surprised:* the Paper Trading
   **screen** still replays a dataset. The live session is reachable from the
   CLI only; wiring it into the Qt screen needs a thread or an asyncio bridge
   and is deliberately left as its own task.
5. **Chapters 15/16/18** — packaging. The Debian packaging is stale:
   `debian/rules` calls `setup.py install` and `debian/control` does not list
   pyqtgraph or platformdirs.
6. **Chapter 48** — machine learning is deliberately unbuilt; it needs a
   dependency decision first (chapter 4) before any code.
7. **Translations** — the Spanish `.ts` still has untranslated strings that
   fall back to English.
8. ~~**Chapter 25 — finish the reference-project study.**~~ **DONE
   2026-10-15.** All eight references are studied and documented in
   `reference-projects.md` Parts A–H; the chapter is `[x]` and its closing
   requirement is met. **This unblocks deleting `external/` (12 GB)** — the
   conclusions are the deliverable, not the vendored copies. Three of the
   four new Parts corrected claims their own projects advertise (see the
   chapter's notes), which is why the roadmap demanded per-feature
   verification.

Anything in `ROADMAP.md` marked `[ ]` or `[~]` is fair game. The roadmap is
the specification; this list is only the recommended order.

### 5.3 How to work here

- Read the chapter that owns the task before writing code.
- Run `make test` (or `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`)
  and check the **exit code**, not only the printed count.
- One requirement per change; tick a ROADMAP box only when it is implemented
  **and** tested; update the documentation in the same change.
- Never install a dependency: stop and report it (see `AGENTS.md` rule 2).
- Real trading stays disabled. That rule has no exceptions.

## 6. Quick-start for the new Agent

```bash
# 1. (Optional) the 8 reference projects under external/ — not needed to
#    build, run or test the application, and 12 GB on disk. Fetch only the
#    one your task studies, e.g.:
git submodule update --init external/freqtrade

# 2. Verify the environment:
python3 --version            # ≥ 3.11 expected (3.13 on record)
python3 -c "import PyQt6, pyqtgraph, sqlalchemy, platformdirs; print('deps OK')"
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 -m pytest tests/ -q   # 894 passed, 2 skipped expected

# 3. Read in this order:
#    1. AGENT-HANDOFF.md (this file) — state and next steps
#    2. AGENTS.md — the non-negotiable rules
#    3. ROADMAP.md — the specification (find the chapter that owns your task)
#    4. CONTRIBUTING.md — workflow and definition of done
#    5. docs/en/developers/afml-techniques.md (when AFML is needed)
```

If the test count differs, stop and report it before changing anything.
