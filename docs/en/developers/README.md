# Developer documentation — index

Where to look, and when. Everything here is in English, which is the source
language for this project (Spanish ships through Qt Linguist).

If you are new, read in this order:

1. [`AGENT-HANDOFF.md`](../../../AGENT-HANDOFF.md) — what exists today and
   where development left off.
2. [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) — the non-negotiable ground rules.
3. [`ROADMAP.md`](../../../ROADMAP.md) — **the specification.** Find the
   chapter that owns your task.
4. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — workflow, definition of
   done and good first contributions.
5. [`architecture-proposal.md`](architecture-proposal.md) — how the layers
   fit together.

## The book rule

*Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (López de Prado, Wiley 2018) is
cited **by bibliographic reference only**. Never copy its text, code, figures
or tables into this repository, and never commit the book. The project's own
specification of every technique it borrows lives in
[`afml-techniques.md`](afml-techniques.md). See `AGENTS.md` rule 6.

## Beginner documentation

The teaching arm of the product lives in
[`../beginners/`](../beginners/): start-here, glossary, indicators,
performance metrics, data splitting, paper trading and regime analysis.
Clarity there is a feature, not an afterthought.
