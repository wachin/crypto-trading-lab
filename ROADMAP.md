# Project: Crypto Trading Lab

Act as a senior software architect, Python/PyQt6 developer, financial systems specialist, automated testing engineer, application security specialist, Debian packaging specialist, technical writer, and educator.

Design and develop a professional desktop application called:

# Crypto Trading Lab

Crypto Trading Lab is an educational, research, simulation, and market-analysis platform for:

- visualizing cryptocurrency markets;
- downloading and storing historical data;
- displaying candlestick charts;
- calculating technical indicators;
- creating rule-based trading strategies;
- running backtests;
- performing paper trading;
- analyzing performance and risk;
- optionally connecting to cryptocurrency exchanges through adapters;
- learning how cryptocurrency markets work;
- teaching complete beginners how to use the application;
- allowing real trading only after strict safety mechanisms have been implemented and validated.

## Vision and mission

The developer's vision, stated plainly:

- Some people genuinely make a living from the cryptocurrency markets — not by luck or hope, but by studying, measuring, and surviving bad seasons. Crypto Trading Lab exists to give its user a real, honest chance of becoming one of them.
- The farmer's truth applies: no one can promise in which year it will rain well, and a farmer who depends on rain can never be assured of profits. In the same way, this program can never **guarantee** gains to whoever uses it. What it can do is maximize the user's real chances: search for a genuine, measurable edge with scientific discipline, validate it out-of-sample, protect the capital, and tell the truth when no edge exists.
- **Mission: seek real profits with statistical honesty — never through hope, hype, or fabricated metrics.**
- **Priority order: (1) survive — never risk money needed to live; (2) validate — only statistically defensible edges; (3) earn — attempt real profits only after (1) and (2) are satisfied.** The developer of this project is in a vulnerable economic situation; this priority order is therefore not optional ideology but the project's reason for survival.
- The method follows *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (Marcos López de Prado) — the discipline of those who actually survive in this field — as studied in `docs/en/developers/reference-projects.md`.

The application must never be presented as a tool that guarantees profits.

It must clearly explain that:

- cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk;
- users can lose part or all of their capital;
- historical performance does not guarantee future results;
- paper trading does not reproduce every real-market condition;
- backtesting can produce misleading results if implemented incorrectly;
- the application is a research, simulation, risk-management, and education tool whose **honest ambition** is to help the user obtain real profits, and whose **non-negotiable duty** is to keep the user financially alive while trying.

Rules:

- Every chapter uses the checklist format `## [ ] N. Chapter name` with `- [ ]` requirement items.
- A strategy must never be able to jump directly from `Backtest → Real Trading`. Qualification is mandatory.
- Research, execution, and risk are separate responsibilities. Never mix them (see Chapter 6.1).
- When a chapter references another, the referenced chapter owns the canonical requirements.

## Where development stands (resume here)

This roadmap is the **specification**, not the status log. The living statement
of what is implemented and what comes next is `AGENT-HANDOFF.md`, which is the
first file any new agent must read:

1. `AGENT-HANDOFF.md` §1 — what exists today (modules, tests, baseline).
2. `AGENT-HANDOFF.md` §5 — the exact continuation point.
3. This file — the requirements of the chapter currently being implemented.
4. `AGENTS.md` — the non-negotiable ground rules.

How to read the checkboxes:

- `- [x]` marks a requirement that is implemented **and tested**.
- Chapter headers use the `[ ]` template; progress is tracked in the sub-items.
- Chapters **7, 26, 27 and 30** were reconciled item by item on 2026-09-13, so
  their boxes reflect what the code implements and what the tests exercise.
  Their remaining open items are genuine pending work: chapter 26.2/26.3 (the
  Binance WebSocket side and all of Coinbase), chapter 27 (retry/backoff,
  circuit breaker, stale-data machinery), chapter 30 (tick size, step size and
  the rest of the pre-trade pipeline).
- Phase roll-up lives in Chapter 69; the working method is Chapter 70.

# PART I — FOUNDATION

---

## [x] 1. Project purpose and scientific principles

Crypto Trading Lab is a **research instrument**, not a market-prediction machine.

The scientific and technical objective is to allow the user to:

- [ ] formulate trading hypotheses;
- [ ] develop strategies;
- [ ] test them on historical data;
- [ ] avoid look-ahead bias and data leakage;
- [ ] separate training, validation, and out-of-sample data correctly;
- [ ] optimize parameters in a controlled way;
- [ ] analyze risk and performance;
- [ ] check robustness;
- [ ] study different market regimes;
- [ ] compare against benchmarks;
- [ ] perform paper trading;
- [ ] eventually evaluate a strategy for real trading under strict safety controls.

The application must favor reproducible and statistically responsible research, **with the explicit goal of finding and validating real edges that can generate real profits** — while never promising that such an edge will be found, and always telling the user the truth when it is not.

### 1.1 What the application is and is not

- [ ] Not a tool that "predicts the market".
- [ ] Not a guarantee of profit — and it must never claim to be one.
- [ ] A serious research instrument whose honest purpose is to find, validate, and help harvest a genuine edge.
- [ ] Not a substitute for financial advice.
- [ ] Not a place where a profitable backtest is treated as evidence of future advantage.

### 1.2 Evidence hierarchy

The interface must distinguish between:

```text
Observed result
Statistical evidence
Research hypothesis
Validated evidence
```

- [ ] "Observed result" = what happened in one historical test.
- [ ] "Statistical evidence" = whether the result is distinguishable from noise (see Chapter 43).
- [ ] "Research hypothesis" = the idea being investigated, never presented as a proven fact.
- [ ] "Validated evidence" = evidence that survived out-of-sample, robustness, and qualification checks (see Chapters 38, 44, and 66).

- [ ] The application must never present an observed backtest result as validated evidence by default.

### 1.3 Educational duty

- [ ] Every complex financial concept must be accompanied by a plain-language explanation.
- [ ] Every financial metric must include an explanation a complete beginner can understand.
- [ ] Every warning must be understandable to a complete beginner.

### 1.4 Realistic expectations

The application must teach realistic expectations grounded in real-world evidence:

- [ ] Explain that a large majority of retail crypto traders lose money (studies commonly report that roughly 70–95% of retail traders lose money, and that most day traders stop within their first two years).
- [ ] Explain that most of those who lose share the same mistakes: no validated edge, no risk control, risking money they need to live. This program exists precisely to be the opposite of that majority.
- [ ] Explain that a profitable backtest does not imply a profitable future (see Chapters 43–45).
- [ ] Explain that trading is not a reliable source of income — the reliable strategy is survival first, edge second.
- [ ] Explain that fees, spread, and slippage reduce net returns and compound over time.
- [ ] Explain that the safest financial decision for most people is not to trade money they cannot afford to lose.
- [ ] Never encourage the user to trade with essential funds, borrowed money, or emergency savings.
- [ ] Include these lessons in the Learning Center (see Chapter 23) and in the beginner documentation (see Chapter 19.2).

---

## [x] 2. Terminology and conventions

These definitions are canonical for the whole document. Use them consistently in code, UI, documentation, and reports.

### 2.1 Costs

- [ ] **Trading fees**: the umbrella term for all costs applied to an order (commission, spread, slippage, and, where applicable, funding/borrowing costs).
- [ ] **Commission**: the exchange fee charged per order. A component of trading fees.
- [ ] **Spread**: the difference between the best bid and the best ask.
- [ ] **Slippage**: the difference between the expected execution price and the actual fill price.
- [ ] **Funding/borrowing costs**: apply only if leveraged or futures products are ever supported. Not applicable to the spot-only MVP.

### 2.2 Order rules

- [ ] **Minimum order quantity**: the smallest quantity of an asset that may be ordered.
- [ ] **Minimum order value/notional**: the smallest quote-currency value an order may have. Distinct from minimum order quantity.
- [ ] **Tick size**: the minimum price increment.
- [ ] **Step size**: the minimum quantity increment.

### 2.3 Entities and flow

- [ ] **Signal**: the output of a strategy ("enter long", "exit long", "hold"). A signal is not an order.
- [ ] **Order**: a request to execute a trade. Created only after a signal passes the risk manager.
- [ ] **Fill**: the executed portion of an order.
- [ ] **Strategy**: defines *when* a signal is generated. Never communicates with an exchange.
- [ ] **Execution**: handles orders, fills, latency, slippage, liquidity, exchange, positions, and balances.
- [ ] **Risk**: enforces limits, exposure, drawdown, position size, losses, restrictions, and emergency stop.

### 2.4 Data

- [ ] **Dataset**: a stored, versioned collection of market data used for research.
- [ ] **Data source**: the origin of data (exchange, CSV file, provider).
- [ ] **Backtest**: a deterministic historical simulation of strategy + execution + risk rules.
- [ ] **Paper trading**: simulated trading on real-time or replayed market data with simulated money.
- [ ] **Historical replay**: a paper-trading mode that replays stored historical data.

### 2.5 Validation periods

- [ ] **Training (strategy-development) period**: data used to develop rules and select initial parameters.
- [ ] **Validation period**: data used to compare candidates and refine hypotheses.
- [ ] **Out-of-sample (test) period**: data reserved for final historical evaluation.

### 2.6 Conventions

- [ ] All internal timestamps use UTC. Local timezone is used only for presentation.
- [ ] Monetary values, prices, quantities, commissions, and balances use `Decimal`, never `float`.
- [ ] The document uses "trading fees", "minimum order quantity", "minimum order value", "signal", "order", "backtest", "paper trading", "dataset", and "data source" as defined above.

## [x] 3. Supported platforms and technologies

### 3.1 Supported platforms

The application must be developed primarily for:

- [ ] Debian 12 Bookworm;
- [ ] Debian 13;
- [ ] MX Linux;
- [ ] AV Linux MXe;
- [ ] Ubuntu;
- [ ] Ubuntu-based distributions;
- [ ] other Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions.

### 3.2 Main technologies

Main technologies:

- [ ] Python 3;
- [ ] PyQt6;
- [x] SQLite;
- [x] Qt Linguist;
- [ ] Qt translation tools;
- [ ] `pyproject.toml`;
- [ ] pytest;
- [ ] Debian `.deb` packaging;
- [ ] an architecture prepared for AppImage distribution.

- [ ] The AppImage packaging process must remain separate from the official Debian package.
- [ ] The project must be Free Software and use a Debian-compatible license, preferably:

```text
GPL-3.0-or-later
```

- [ ] Do not use proprietary components or services that require mandatory payment.

---

## [x] 4. Debian dependency priority

Prioritize dependencies available in the official Debian 12 repositories before adding dependencies from PyPI.

### 4.0 MANDATORY STOP RULE for dependencies

The AI Agent must apply this rule without exception:

- [ ] If at any point the development requires installing a new dependency, the Agent must **STOP** development immediately at that task.
- [ ] The Agent must **NOT** install anything by itself: no `apt install`, no `pip install`, no `pip --user`, no downloading of packages or wheels.
- [ ] Instead, the Agent must **notify the developer** with:
  1. the exact package name;
  2. whether it comes from the Debian repositories or from PyPI;
  3. the reason it is needed;
  4. the exact command the developer must run.
- [ ] If the package exists in the Debian repositories, the developer installs it with `apt`; the Agent then verifies the import works and continues.
- [ ] If the package exists only on PyPI, the developer must create and activate a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv .venv`), and only then may the Agent use it inside that venv. The Agent must never create, activate, or install into a venv on its own.
- [ ] To this day no venv has been needed because every required package is available in the distribution; the first PyPI-only dependency will require this venv procedure, and the Agent must warn the developer before that happens.
- [ ] The Agent must not proceed past a missing dependency, must not mock a missing import to pretend work continues, and must record the blocker in the final report until the developer resolves it.

Before choosing any dependency:

1. [ ] confirm whether it exists in Debian 12;
2. [ ] confirm its exact Debian package name;
3. [ ] verify its version;
4. [ ] verify its license;
5. [ ] determine whether it is suitable for runtime, development, packaging, or optional use;
6. [ ] avoid adding a PyPI dependency when the Python standard library, Qt, or an official Debian package already solves the problem adequately.

### 4.1 Graphical interface

Evaluate and use the following Debian packages where appropriate:

- [ ] `python3-pyqt6`
- [ ] `python3-pyqt6.qtcharts`
- [ ] `python3-pyqt6.qtwebsockets`
- [ ] `python3-pyqt6.qtsvg`
- [ ] `python3-pyqt6.qtdesigner`
- [ ] `pyqt6-dev-tools`
- [ ] `python3-superqt`

### 4.2 Charting libraries

Research and evaluate:

- [ ] `python3-pyqtgraph`
- [ ] `python3-pyqt6.qtcharts`
- [ ] `python3-matplotlib`

- [x] Create an internal chart abstraction so that the chart backend can be replaced without modifying the financial domain or strategy logic.

Initial preference:

- [ ] PyQtGraph for real-time charts, candlesticks, volume, and fast updates;
- [ ] Matplotlib for static reports, statistical charts, and exported graphics;
- [ ] Qt Charts where it is suitable and does not create performance limitations.

- [ ] Do not use Qt WebEngine for the main charts unless there is a documented technical justification.

### 4.3 Data processing and analysis

Evaluate:

- [ ] `python3-numpy`
- [ ] `python3-pandas`
- [ ] `python3-scipy`
- [ ] `python3-statsmodels`
- [ ] `python3-sklearn`
- [ ] `python3-numba`

Use:

- [ ] NumPy for numerical arrays and vectorized calculations;
- [ ] pandas for time series, tables, imports, exports, and analysis;
- [ ] SciPy when advanced statistical or numerical functions are required;
- [ ] statsmodels when statistically justified;
- [ ] scikit-learn only for optional research experiments;
- [ ] Numba only as an optional performance optimization.

- [ ] Machine learning must not be a mandatory part of the initial application.
- [ ] Do not describe machine learning as a method that can predict the market with certainty.
- [ ] Machine learning details are defined in Chapter 48.

### 4.4 Networking

Evaluate:

- [ ] `python3-aiohttp`
- [ ] `python3-websockets`
- [ ] `python3-requests`
- [ ] `python3-requests-cache`
- [ ] `python3-ratelimiter`

Analyze whether the application should use:

- [ ] 1. `aiohttp` for REST and WebSocket communication;
- [ ] 2. `websockets` for WebSocket connections;
- [ ] 3. `QNetworkAccessManager` and `QWebSocket` for Qt-native networking.

- [ ] Create interfaces that remain independent of the specific transport implementation.
- [ ] Never block the Qt main thread.

### 4.5 Persistence and validation

Evaluate:

- [ ] `python3-sqlalchemy`
- [ ] `python3-pydantic`
- [ ] `python3-dateutil`
- [ ] `python3-platformdirs`
- [ ] `python3-yaml`
- [ ] `python3-jsonschema`

- [ ] SQLite must be the default database.
- [ ] Do not make PostgreSQL a requirement for the desktop application.
- [ ] PostgreSQL may be considered as a future optional backend, but it must not be part of the MVP runtime requirements.

### 4.6 Security

Evaluate:

- [ ] `python3-keyring`
- [ ] `python3-cryptography`

API keys and secrets must never be stored:

- [ ] in plain text;
- [ ] inside the Git repository;
- [ ] in `.json` files;
- [ ] in `.yaml` files;
- [ ] in `.toml` files;
- [ ] in `.ini` files;
- [ ] in debug logs;
- [ ] in error reports;
- [ ] in SQLite without proper protection.

- [ ] Use the operating system credential store through `keyring`.

The application must also work without credentials for:

- [ ] public market data;
- [ ] imported CSV data;
- [ ] offline demonstrations;
- [x] backtesting;
- [x] paper trading;
- [ ] educational exercises.

### 4.7 Testing and code quality

Evaluate:

- [ ] `python3-pytest`
- [ ] `python3-pytest-asyncio`
- [ ] `python3-pytest-cov`
- [ ] `python3-requests-mock`
- [ ] `python3-freezegun`
- [ ] `python3-flake8`
- [ ] `python3-mypy`
- [ ] `python3-bandit`
- [ ] `python3-black`
- [ ] `python3-isort`

Classify each dependency as one of the following:

- [ ] required runtime dependency;
- [ ] recommended runtime dependency;
- [ ] optional dependency;
- [ ] development-only dependency;
- [ ] packaging-only dependency;
- [ ] available only from PyPI;
- [ ] unnecessary because the standard library or Qt is sufficient.

- [ ] Do not add external dependencies unnecessarily.

---

## [x] 5. Mandatory project principles

The application must comply with the following rules:

- [ ] 1. Paper trading must be the default mode.
- [ ] 2. Real trading must be disabled in the initial build.
- [ ] 3. Futures must not be implemented in the MVP.
- [ ] 4. Margin trading must not be implemented in the MVP.
- [ ] 5. Leverage must not be implemented in the MVP.
- [ ] 6. The MVP must support spot markets only.
- [ ] 7. Martingale strategies must not be implemented.
- [ ] 8. The application must never double position size automatically after a loss.
- [ ] 9. The application must never promise profits.
- [ ] 10. The application must never request API withdrawal permissions.
- [ ] 11. The application must reject or warn about API keys with withdrawal permissions.
- [ ] 12. Strategies must never bypass the central risk manager.
- [ ] 13. Every order must pass through validation before being submitted.
- [ ] 14. The application must operate fully without API keys.
- [ ] 15. Automated tests must never use real funds.
- [ ] 16. The application must not implement market manipulation.
- [ ] 17. The application must not implement spoofing.
- [ ] 18. The application must not implement wash trading.
- [ ] 19. The application must not implement front-running.
- [ ] 20. The application must not abuse exchange APIs.
- [ ] 21. User strategy rules must not execute arbitrary Python code.
- [ ] 22. Do not use `eval()`.
- [ ] 23. Do not use `exec()`.
- [ ] 24. Do not dynamically import untrusted strategy code.
- [ ] 25. Educational explanations must accompany complex financial concepts.
- [ ] 26. Every financial metric must include a plain-language explanation.
- [ ] 27. Every warning must be understandable to a complete beginner.
- [ ] 28. The application must never encourage trading with money the user cannot afford to lose.
- [ ] 29. The application must warn when the user indicates financial hardship or an inability to absorb losses.
- [ ] 30. The application must never suggest borrowing money to trade.
- [ ] 31. The application must not present trading as a solution to financial problems.

---

## [x] 6. Architecture

Use a modular, maintainable, testable architecture.

- [ ] Propose a Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture adapted to a PyQt6 desktop application.

Clearly separate:

- [ ] financial domain;
- [ ] application use cases;
- [ ] market-data providers;
- [ ] exchange adapters;
- [ ] strategy engine;
- [ ] backtesting engine;
- [ ] paper-trading engine;
- [ ] execution engine;
- [ ] order management;
- [ ] risk management;
- [ ] portfolio management;
- [ ] persistence;
- [ ] PyQt6 interface;
- [x] configuration;
- [ ] security;
- [ ] reporting;
- [ ] internationalization;
- [ ] beginner education;
- [ ] user documentation.

### 6.1 Research / Execution / Risk separation

This is a mandatory architectural rule (see also Chapter 2):

- [ ] **Research** owns: hypotheses, experiments, statistics, datasets, features, optimization, validation, robustness, machine learning, strategy comparison, regime analysis, reproducibility.
- [ ] **Execution** owns: signals, orders, fills, latency, slippage, liquidity, exchange, positions, balances.
- [ ] **Risk** owns: limits, exposure, drawdown, position size, losses, restrictions, emergency stop.

- [ ] Research components must not submit orders.
- [ ] Execution components must not modify risk limits.
- [ ] Risk components must not design strategies.
- [ ] The backtesting engine must not be expanded into a general research toolbox; research methods live in their own chapters (Chapters 43–51).

### 6.2 Suggested structure

- [ ] `crypto-trading-lab/`

## [x] 25. Reference projects

The repositories under `external/` are **technical and architectural references**.

- [ ] They should be consulted to study concepts, gather ideas, or, if possible, adapt the code for use.
- [ ] If a feature in a reference project is assumed, verify it in that project's documentation first; never assume a feature exists because the project name suggests it.

Technical references:

- [ ] **Backtrader** (`external/backtrader`): study event-driven backtesting design, analyzers (Sharpe, drawdown, trade analysis, SQN, VWR, Calmar), broker simulation, and feed handling. Use as inspiration for Chapter 37, not as a runtime dependency.
- [ ] **CCXT** (`external/ccxt`): study the unified exchange API design, market metadata normalization (precision, limits), REST/WebSocket abstraction, and the many exchange quirks handled. Use as inspiration for Chapter 26 exchange adapters; verify Debian/PyPI packaging before use.
- [ ] **Freqtrade** (`external/freqtrade`): study strategy/execution separation, dry-run (paper) mode, hyperopt (parameter optimization), persistence, and its cautious default posture. Inspect for Chapters 33, 39, and 57.
- [ ] **Hummingbot** (`external/hummingbot`): study execution and order-management design, market-making/arbitrage logic, and connector architecture. Inspect for Chapters 56 and 26.
- [ ] **Jesse** (`external/jesse`): study its research loop: backtest, optimization, Monte Carlo simulation, rule significance testing, and machine-learning pipeline. Inspect for Chapters 43–50; note that Jesse's feature set must be verified per feature.
- [ ] **TA-Lib** (`external/ta-lib`): study the indicator catalog and naming. It is a C library; check whether the Python wrapper is available as a Debian package before use. Indicator requirements remain defined by Chapter 31.
- [ ] **VectorBT** (`external/vectorbt`): study vectorized backtesting, walk-forward optimization, and portfolio analytics concepts. Inspect for Chapters 37 and 45; verify Debian/PyPI packaging.
- [ ] **Advances in Financial Machine Learning — exercises** (`external/adv-financial-ml-marcos-exercises`): study the exercise solutions and the book's own snippets: event-based bars, triple-barrier labeling, sample weighting, purged/embargoed cross-validation, feature importance, and parallelization. Reference for Chapters 29, 38, and 43–50; the code is MIT-licensed and may be adapted with attribution after review and testing.
- [ ] **Advances in Financial Machine Learning** (Marcos López de Prado, Wiley, 2018) — the printed reference behind the exercise repository. Conceptual authority for Chapters 43–50, especially the False Strategy theorem, the Deflated Sharpe Ratio, the Probability of Backtest Overfitting, and combinatorial purged cross-validation. Verify every technique against the exercise repository before implementing it.

- [ ] Document the conclusions of this study in `docs/en/developers/reference-projects.md`.
- [ ] When studying each reference project, explicitly note which mechanisms protect capital (risk limits, position sizing, kill switches, dry-run modes, conservative defaults) and which mechanisms only optimize historical performance. Only the former may be adopted for capital-protection features; the latter belong to research chapters (Chapters 39, 44–45).

- [ ] Every research result must record the exact dataset version and checksum used (see Chapters 38, 52, and 53).
- [ ] The application must never silently fill missing candles in a way that could affect research conclusions; any filling policy must be explicit, documented, and recorded.

### 29.1 Advanced bar types (research)

Beyond time-based candles, the system may support event-based bars for research (see 49.1):

- [ ] volume bars (a new bar after a fixed amount of volume);
- [ ] dollar bars (a new bar after a fixed traded value);
- [ ] imbalance bars where the data source provides trade-level data;
- [ ] every bar type must be a first-class dataset with its own ID, version, and checksum;
- [ ] bar construction must record its thresholds and parameters;
- [ ] event-based bars must be clearly distinguishable from time candles in the UI and the database;
- [ ] missing-data policies for event-based bars must be explicit (their cadence is irregular by design and must not be treated as gaps in a time series).

# PART IV — STRATEGIES AND SIGNALS

---

## [x] 33. Strategies

Strategies must use explicit, testable, versioned, and declarative rules.

The purpose of a strategy is to define **when a trading signal should be generated**. A strategy must not be responsible for exchange communication, order execution, credential handling, or direct risk-limit modification.

Initial strategies:

* [x] 1. Moving-average crossover.
* [ ] 2. RSI with configurable filters.
* [ ] 3. Rolling high/low breakout.
* [ ] 4. Bollinger Bands mean reversion as an educational example.

### 33.5 Signal generation

Strategies must generate explicit signals such as:

* [ ] Enter long.
* [ ] Exit long.
* [ ] Enter short where supported.
* [ ] Exit short where supported.
* [ ] Hold.
* [ ] No signal.

Signals must include:

* [ ] Timestamp.

### 33.6 Mandatory architecture

The execution flow must be:

```text
Market Data
    ↓
Strategy
    ↓
Signal
    ↓
Portfolio / Risk Manager
    ↓
Approved Order Request
    ↓
Execution Engine
    ↓
Broker / Exchange
```

* [ ] Strategies generate signals but do not create exchange orders directly.
* [ ] No strategy may communicate directly with an exchange API.
* [ ] No strategy may bypass the `RiskManager`.
* [ ] No strategy may modify global risk limits.
* [ ] No strategy may access API credentials directly.

* [ ] Validate its required indicators.
* [ ] Validate its timeframe.
* [ ] Validate its warm-up period.
* [ ] Validate its market compatibility.
* [ ] Validate all parameters.
* [ ] Detect impossible or contradictory rules.
* [ ] Report warnings before execution.

### 33.8 Strategy research warnings

The application must warn users that:

* [ ] A strategy can perform well historically by chance.
* [ ] More parameters increase the risk of overfitting.
* [ ] Adding filters does not necessarily improve a strategy.
* [ ] A higher historical profit does not necessarily mean a better strategy.
* [ ] A strategy must be evaluated on data that was not used to design or optimize it.
* [ ] Strategy complexity should be recorded (see Chapter 35).
* [ ] The system should favor simpler strategies when performance is otherwise comparable.

### 33.9 Beginner documentation

Every strategy must explain:

* [ ] What indicators it uses.
* [ ] What causes an entry.
* [ ] What causes an exit.
* [ ] How position sizing works.
* [ ] How stop-loss and take-profit work.
* [ ] What market conditions may favor it.
* [ ] What market conditions may hurt it.
* [ ] Why historical profitability does not guarantee future profitability.

- [ ] indicator;
- [ ] operator;
- [ ] value;
- [ ] crossover;
- [ ] AND condition;
- [ ] OR condition;
- [ ] entry;
- [ ] exit;
- [ ] stop-loss;
- [ ] take-profit;
- [ ] time filter;
- [ ] volatility filter;
- [ ] cooldown.

- [ ] Do not use `eval()`.
- [ ] Convert rules into a validated expression tree.

Allow users to:

- [ ] save;
- [ ] duplicate;
- [ ] export;
- [ ] import;
- [ ] validate;
- [ ] view a natural-language explanation;
- [ ] view a beginner-friendly explanation;
- [ ] view warnings about possible overfitting.

- [ ] Use a versioned schema for strategy files.

---

## [x] 35. Strategy complexity control

The system must consider strategy complexity explicitly.

- [ ] Record for every strategy version:
  - [ ] number of parameters;
  - [ ] number of rules;
  - [ ] number of indicators;
  - [ ] number of filters;
  - [ ] number of conditions;
  - [ ] optimization complexity;
  - [ ] model complexity where machine learning is used (see Chapter 48).

- [ ] A strategy with many parameters, indicators, and filters must not be considered automatically superior to a simpler one.
- [ ] When two strategies provide comparable evidence, the simpler strategy must be favored.
- [ ] Complexity metrics must be displayed in strategy reports and qualification reviews (see Chapter 66).
- [ ] The application must warn when complexity grows without a corresponding evidence improvement.

---

## [x] 36. Strategy registry

The system must maintain a central registry of strategies and their evidence.

Each strategy must be able to record:

- [ ] strategy ID;
- [x] name;
- [x] version;
- [ ] code/configuration;
- [x] parameters;
- [ ] datasets used;
- [x] results. (from backtest metrics)
- [ ] benchmarks;
- [ ] validations;
- [ ] robustness tests;
- [ ] experiment history (see Chapter 52);
- [ ] status;
- [ ] qualification report reference (see Chapter 66);
- [ ] complexity metrics (see Chapter 35).

Suggested statuses:

```text
Draft
Research
Backtested
Validated
Paper Trading
Qualified
Rejected
Retired
Live
```

- [ ] Status transitions must follow the promotion pipeline (see Chapter 65).
- [ ] A strategy must never skip from `Backtested` directly to `Live`.
- [ ] Every status change must be audited with timestamp and reason.
- [ ] The registry must support searching, filtering, and comparing strategies.
- [ ] The registry must clearly distinguish a strategy's current status from its historical statuses.

---

# PART V — BACKTESTING AND VALIDATION

---

## [x] 37. Backtesting

The backtesting engine must be deterministic, reproducible, realistic, and explicitly protected against look-ahead bias and other forms of historical-data leakage.

A backtest must simulate the complete sequence from market data to signal, risk decision, order creation, execution, position update, and portfolio valuation.

### 37.1 Capital and trading costs

The engine must support:

* [x] Initial capital.
* [x] Commissions.
* [x] Trading fees.
* [x] Spread.
* [x] Slippage.
* [ ] Funding costs where applicable (not applicable to the spot-only MVP).
* [ ] Borrowing costs where applicable.
* [x] Configurable trading costs.
* [ ] Cost changes over time where historical fee data is available.

The report must show:

* [x] Total commissions and fees.
* [x] Estimated spread cost.
* [x] Estimated slippage cost.
* [ ] Other applicable trading costs.
* [x] Performance before costs.
* [x] Performance after costs.

### 37.2 Market and exchange constraints

The engine must model, where applicable:

* [ ] Available liquidity.
* [ ] Maximum position size.
* [x] Minimum order quantity.
* [x] Minimum order value/notional.
* [ ] Tick size.
* [x] Step size.
* [ ] Price precision.
* [x] Quantity precision.
* [ ] Exchange-specific trading constraints.
* [ ] Market-specific restrictions.

The backtest must never assume that an arbitrary quantity or price can be submitted to an exchange.

### 37.3 Order types

The engine must support, at minimum:

* [x] Market orders.
* [ ] Limit orders.
* [ ] Stop orders.
* [ ] Stop-loss.
* [ ] Take-profit.
* [ ] Trailing stop.
* [ ] Partial fills.
* [ ] Rejected orders.
* [ ] Order cancellation where applicable.

### 37.4 Execution simulation

The engine must explicitly model the difference between:

```text
Signal generated
        ↓
Order requested
        ↓
Order accepted/rejected
        ↓
Order executed
        ↓
Position updated
```

It must support:

* [ ] Simulated execution latency.
* [x] Conservative slippage assumptions.
* [x] Spread.
* [ ] Available liquidity.
* [ ] Partial execution.
* [ ] Rejected orders.
* [ ] Delayed execution.
* [ ] Order cancellation.
* [ ] Different execution models.

Implement at least two execution models:

* [x] 1. Execution at the opening price of the next candle.
* [ ] 2. A documented conservative intrabar execution model.

The selected execution model must be recorded in every backtest.

- [ ] Advanced execution realism (fills, latency, liquidity models) is specified in Chapter 56 and must remain a separate component.

### 37.5 Intrabar ambiguity

When historical data does not provide enough information to determine the exact sequence of events inside a candle:

* [ ] Never invent an execution sequence.
* [ ] Use a configurable conservative policy.
* [ ] Document the policy.
* [ ] Record the policy in the backtest metadata.
* [ ] Clearly identify ambiguous executions in the report.

When a candle reaches both stop-loss and take-profit during the same interval:

* [ ] Apply the configured conservative policy.
* [ ] Record which policy was used.
* [ ] Never assume an execution order that cannot be established from the available data.

### 37.6 Historical data handling

The engine must correctly handle:

* [ ] Missing data.
* [ ] Missing candles.
* [ ] Incomplete candles.
* [ ] Duplicate candles.
* [ ] Out-of-order timestamps.
* [ ] Invalid OHLCV values.
* [ ] Zero or invalid volume where applicable.
* [ ] Chronological data ordering.
* [ ] Warm-up periods.
* [ ] Dataset boundaries.
* [ ] Delisted assets where historical data is available.
* [ ] Changes in market liquidity where historical data is available.

All internal timestamps must use a clearly defined convention, preferably UTC.

- [ ] Data-quality policies are specified in Chapter 29 and must be shared with the backtest engine.

### 37.7 Bias and leakage prevention

The engine must explicitly prevent:

* [ ] Look-ahead bias.
* [ ] Data leakage.
* [ ] Survivorship bias where applicable.
* [ ] Future information entering historical signals.
* [ ] Future candles being used to calculate historical indicators.
* [ ] Using a known closing price to execute at that same close without an explicit model.
* [ ] Assuming all orders execute instantly.
* [ ] Ignoring commissions, fees, spread, slippage, or liquidity constraints.

> **The backtesting engine must never use information that was unavailable at the exact moment when the simulated trading decision was made.**

### 37.8 Determinism and reproducibility

A backtest must produce the same result when executed again with the same:

* [ ] Dataset version.
* [ ] Strategy version.
* [ ] Strategy parameters.
* [ ] Initial capital.
* [ ] Fee configuration.
* [ ] Spread configuration.
* [ ] Slippage configuration.
* [ ] Execution model.
* [ ] Software configuration.
* [ ] Random seed when randomness is used.

Every backtest must record enough metadata to reproduce the experiment (see Chapter 53).

### 37.9 Backtest results

Every backtest must record:

* [x] Initial capital.
* [x] Final equity.
* [x] Net profit/loss.
* [x] Total return.
* [x] Number of trades.
* [x] Win rate.
* [x] Average winning trade.
* [x] Average losing trade.
* [x] Profit factor.
* [x] Maximum drawdown.
* [x] Maximum drawdown duration.
* [x] Sharpe ratio where statistically appropriate.
* [x] Sortino ratio where statistically appropriate.
* [x] Buy-and-hold performance (see Chapter 42).
* [x] Total commissions/fees.
* [x] Estimated slippage.
* [x] Execution model.
* [x] Dataset period.
* [x] Dataset version.
* [x] Strategy version.
* [x] Strategy parameters.

- [x] Metric definitions and statistical validity rules are specified in Chapter 40.

### 37.10 Beginner-oriented explanation

Every backtest result must explain:

* [x] What was tested.
* [x] Which asset and timeframe were tested.
* [x] Which strategy and parameters were used.
* [x] Which historical period was used.
* [x] What assumptions were made.
* [x] Which execution model was used.
* [x] What commissions and fees mean.
* [x] What spread and slippage mean.
* [x] Why liquidity affects execution.
* [x] Why historical results can be misleading.
* [x] Why backtesting cannot guarantee future profitability.
* [x] Why real trading results may differ.
* [x] Whether the result is in-sample, validation, or out-of-sample.

- [x] A profitable backtest must never be presented as proof that a strategy will be profitable in the future.

---

## [x] 38. Data splitting

Financial time-series data must be divided chronologically.

The system must support at least:

* [x] Training (strategy-development) period.
* [x] Validation period.
* [x] Out-of-sample test period.

The default data flow must be:

```text
Historical Data
      ↓
Training (Strategy Development)
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Out-of-Sample Test
```

### 38.1 Chronological integrity

* [x] Never randomly shuffle financial time-series data for strategy evaluation. (splitting is deterministic; shuffled input is rejected)
* [x] Preserve temporal ordering.
* [x] Prevent future observations from entering earlier periods.
* [x] Respect dataset boundaries.
* [x] Respect indicator warm-up periods. (borrowed warm-up prefixes, excluded from the recorded boundaries)
* [x] Record the exact timestamp boundaries of every split.

### 38.2 Training (strategy-development) period

This period may be used for:

* [ ] Strategy development.
* [ ] Indicator selection.
* [ ] Rule development.
* [ ] Initial parameter selection.
* [ ] Hypothesis generation.

It must not be presented as independent evidence of future performance.

### 38.3 Validation period

The validation period may be used for:

* [ ] Comparing candidate strategies.
* [ ] Selecting among limited parameter sets.
* [ ] Detecting obvious overfitting.
* [ ] Refining a research hypothesis.

Repeated use of the validation set must be recorded because it can gradually become part of the optimization process.

### 38.4 Out-of-sample test period

The out-of-sample period must:

* [ ] Remain isolated from strategy development as much as possible.
* [ ] Not be used repeatedly for parameter selection.
* [ ] Be used as the final historical evaluation of a strategy version.
* [ ] Be clearly identified in reports.

### 38.5 Data leakage protection

The system must detect or warn about:

* [x] Indicators calculated using future data. (engine guarantee: signals at close i fill at open i+1, ch. 37)
* [x] Features containing future observations. (same construction)
* [ ] Optimization using the test period. — pending: optimization is chapter 39; the evaluation log is the guardrail in place.
* [x] Repeated evaluation of the test period. (`DatasetSplit.record_evaluation` warns from the second use)
* [x] Using future market information. (same construction as above)
* [x] Randomized time-series splitting. (never shuffles; shuffled input is rejected)
* [x] Incorrect warm-up handling. (borrowed prefixes excluded from recorded boundaries)

### 38.6 Optimization separation

When a strategy has been optimized:

* [ ] The optimization period must be recorded.
* [ ] The validation period must be recorded.
* [ ] The out-of-sample period must be recorded.
* [ ] The application must warn if the same period is used for both optimization and final evaluation.

- [ ] Rolling-window validation (walk-forward) is a distinct concept and is specified in Chapter 45.

### 38.7 Beginner explanation

The application must explain:

* [x] Why historical data is divided.
* [x] Why testing on the same data used for optimization is misleading.
* [x] What out-of-sample means.
* [x] Why repeatedly checking the test period can cause overfitting.
* [x] Why chronological order matters.
* [x] Why good out-of-sample performance is stronger evidence than in-sample performance.

The system must clearly distinguish:

> **“The strategy worked on historical data used to design it”**

from:

> **“The strategy continued to work on data that was not used to design it.”**

### 38.8 Purged and embargoed cross-validation (research)

Standard K-Fold cross-validation is invalid for financial time series when labels overlap in time (e.g., multi-bar holding periods) or when features are serially dependent.

The system may support, as a research capability (see 49.4):

- [ ] purged cross-validation: remove training observations whose label windows overlap validation-label windows;
- [ ] embargo: additionally delete a documented buffer after each validation block before resuming training;
- [ ] the embargo length must be an explicit, recorded parameter, never implicit;
- [ ] warn whenever labels span multiple bars and plain K-Fold or plain walk-forward splits are requested, because leakage is likely;
- [ ] explain in beginner terms why a trade that is still open at a boundary leaks information across it.

## [x] 39. Parameter optimization

Parameter optimization is a research tool, not a guarantee of better future performance.

Initially include:

* [ ] Limited grid search.
* [ ] Limited random search.

Do not include unrestricted automatic optimization in the MVP.

### 39.1 Optimization inputs

Every optimization experiment must record:

* [ ] Strategy version.
* [ ] Parameter ranges.
* [ ] Parameter combinations.
* [ ] Dataset version.
* [ ] Optimization period.
* [ ] Validation period.
* [ ] Out-of-sample period.
* [ ] Initial capital.
* [ ] Fee configuration.
* [ ] Slippage configuration.
* [ ] Execution model.
* [ ] Random seed where applicable.

### 39.2 Safety limits

The optimizer must enforce:

* [ ] Maximum number of combinations.
* [ ] Maximum execution time where practical.
* [ ] Maximum memory usage where practical.
* [ ] Cancel button.
* [ ] Progress indicator.
* [ ] Background execution.
* [ ] Safe cancellation.
* [ ] Persisted results.

### 39.3 Optimization objective

The optimizer must not select a strategy solely because it has the highest net profit.

Supported objectives may include:

* [ ] Net profit.
* [ ] Total return.
* [ ] Maximum drawdown.
* [ ] Profit factor.
* [ ] Sharpe ratio where appropriate.
* [ ] Sortino ratio where appropriate.
* [ ] Calmar ratio where appropriate.
* [ ] Risk-adjusted return.
* [ ] Composite score.

The objective and ranking method must always be visible.

### 39.4 Overfitting protection

The optimizer must:

* [ ] Warn about excessive parameter combinations.
* [ ] Warn when parameter ranges are excessively broad.
* [ ] Penalize unnecessary complexity where appropriate (see Chapter 35).
* [ ] Compare in-sample and validation performance.
* [ ] Require out-of-sample evaluation before a strategy can be considered robust.
* [ ] Show performance degradation between datasets.
* [ ] Identify unstable parameter regions where practical.

### 39.5 Parameter stability

The system should identify whether:

* [ ] A broad region of parameters produces similar results.
* [ ] Performance depends on one extremely specific parameter combination.
* [ ] Small parameter changes cause large performance changes.
* [ ] The optimized result is substantially better than neighboring configurations.

A strategy whose performance exists only at one highly specific parameter combination must receive an overfitting warning.

### 39.6 Optimization results

Each experiment must preserve:

* [ ] Parameter set.
* [ ] Performance metrics.
* [ ] Dataset.
* [ ] Execution assumptions.
* [ ] Ranking objective.
* [ ] Optimization timestamp.
* [ ] Software version.
* [ ] Experiment identifier.

- [ ] Experiments must be recorded in the research experiment manager (see Chapter 52).

### 39.7 Beginner explanation

The application must explain:

* [ ] What parameter optimization is.
* [ ] Why optimization can help.
* [ ] Why optimization can also overfit historical data.
* [ ] Why the best historical parameter set is not necessarily the best future parameter set.
* [ ] Why out-of-sample testing is necessary.
* [ ] Why simpler parameter sets may be preferable.

> **Optimization searches historical possibilities. It does not predict which parameter values will be optimal in the future.**

# PART VI — PERFORMANCE, REPORTING, AND BENCHMARKING

---

## [x] 40. Performance metrics

The application must calculate performance metrics consistently, transparently, and with appropriate statistical safeguards.

No single metric must be presented as proof that a strategy is good, safe, or profitable in the future.

  is long-only spot by construction; there are no shorts to measure.

### 40.4 Trading activity

Calculate:

* [x] Turnover.
* [x] Number of orders.
* [ ] Number of rejected orders. — pending: the engine always fills
  or skips; rejections only exist once a paper-trading layer (ch. 57)
  can produce them.
* [ ] Number of partially filled orders. — pending: the engine fills
  all-or-nothing; partial fills require a more detailed fill model.
* [x] Commissions.
* [x] Trading fees.
* [x] Estimated spread cost.
* [x] Estimated slippage.
* [ ] Funding costs where applicable. — pending: spot trading has no
  funding; requires futures/margin support.

### 40.5 Benchmark comparison

- [x] Every applicable strategy evaluation must compare against a benchmark (see Chapter 42). — implemented via the `benchmark` argument of `compute_performance` (chapter 42 owns the benchmark *selection* policy).

The report must clearly distinguish:

* [x] Absolute performance.
* [x] Benchmark performance.
* [x] Difference from benchmark.

### 40.6 Statistical validity

The application must avoid displaying misleading metrics when there is insufficient data.

For example:

* [x] Do not present annualized metrics for inappropriate periods.
* [x] Do not present Sharpe or Sortino as reliable conclusions with insufficient observations.
* [x] Identify metrics affected by small sample sizes.
* [x] Display warnings when the number of trades is very small.

* [x] Drawdown.
* [x] Trading costs.
* [x] Number of trades.
* [x] Market conditions.
* [x] Out-of-sample performance.
* [x] Robustness tests.

## [x] 41. Reports

Generate backtesting, paper-trading, research, and qualification reports in:

- [x] HTML;
- [x] CSV;
- [x] JSON;
- [ ] optional PDF. — pending: would require a new dependency; stdlib
  only so far. (Paper-trading/research/qualification reports will reuse
  `reporting.report` once chapters 52 and 57 exist.)

Reports must include:

- [x] strategy;
- [x] version;
- [x] parameters;
- [x] dataset checksum or identifier;
- [x] time range;
- [x] exchange;
- [x] trading pair;
- [x] interval;
- [x] initial capital;
- [x] fees;
- [x] slippage;
- [x] execution model;
- [x] metrics;
- [x] trades;
- [x] equity curve;
- [x] drawdown;
- [x] benchmark;
- [x] warnings;
- [x] Crypto Trading Lab version;
- [x] generation date.

- [x] Reports must not claim future profitability.
- [x] Include an optional beginner summary that explains the results in plain language.
- [x] Reports must clearly label the evidence level of any conclusion (observed result, statistical evidence, hypothesis, validated evidence; see Chapters 1 and 43). — backtest reports are labelled "observed result" (single in-sample run; descriptive only).
- [ ] Research and qualification reports must cite the experiment identifier (see Chapter 52). — pending: the experiment manager (ch. 52) does not exist yet.

---

## [x] 42. Benchmarking

The system must compare strategies against:

- [x] buy-and-hold;
- [x] simple benchmarks; (null strategy available)
- [ ] eventually other strategies. — `compare_reports()` accepts any
  strategy's report; the Lab UI offers buy-and-hold and null so far.

- [x] Do not assume that an active strategy is good simply because it makes money. (plain-language verdict in the comparison view)

Every comparison must ask:

> **Does the strategy offer enough improvement over a passive alternative, considering risk, costs, and complexity?**

### 42.1 Benchmark requirements

- [x] Same evaluation period for strategy and benchmark. (both are run on the same candles)
- [x] Same initial capital for strategy and benchmark. (shared `BacktestConfig`)
- [x] Comparable cost assumptions where appropriate. (shared `CostModel`)
- [x] Comparative performance metrics.
- [x] Relative performance.
- [x] Buy-and-hold must be the default benchmark for every strategy backtest.
- [x] The chosen benchmark must be recorded in every report. (chapter 41 report fields)
- [x] Benchmark selection must be visible and changeable by the user. (Backtesting Lab benchmark selector)
- [x] The application must warn when a benchmark is inappropriate for the strategy's market or timeframe. (identical-strategy benchmarks are flagged; other mismatches are impossible because both runs always share the same dataset)

### 42.2 Benchmark comparison views

- [ ] Equity curve comparison. — textual differences implemented
  (`compare_reports`); graphical overlay views pending.
- [ ] Drawdown comparison. — textual max-drawdown difference
  implemented; graphical underwater overlay pending.
- [x] Risk-adjusted comparison where appropriate. (Sharpe/Sortino
  differences, suppressed when statistically invalid)
- [x] Cost-adjusted comparison. (gross excess return + cost drag)
- [x] A plain-language summary of whether the active strategy beat the passive alternative.

- [ ] Benchmarking results feed the strategy qualification process (see Chapter 66). — pending: the qualification pipeline does not exist yet.

# PART VII — STATISTICAL RESEARCH AND ROBUSTNESS

---

## [x] 43. Statistical edge and evidence

The roadmap must incorporate a fundamental concept:

> **A historically profitable strategy does not necessarily have a real statistical edge.**

The system must allow investigating:

- [x] mathematical expectation;
- [x] distribution of returns;
- [ ] distribution of trades;
- [x] variability;
- [x] confidence;
- [x] uncertainty;
- [x] stability;
- [x] statistical significance where appropriate;
- [x] sample size;
- [x] temporal dependence;
- [x] autocorrelation;
- [x] bootstrap;
- [ ] sensitivity analysis;
- [x] comparison against benchmarks (see Chapter 42).

### 43.1 Evidence levels

The interface must distinguish:

```text
Observed result
Statistical evidence
Research hypothesis
Validated evidence
```

- [x] A single backtest result is an observed result, never validated evidence.
- [x] Statistical evidence requires explicit, documented methods and sufficient sample sizes.
- [x] A research hypothesis must always be labeled as such.
- [ ] Validated evidence requires out-of-sample, robustness, walk-forward, and qualification checks (see Chapters 44–46 and 66).
- [x] Account for the number of trials actually performed when interpreting a result: the more configurations tested, the more likely a good historical result is pure chance (the multiple-testing problem, related to the False Strategy theorem).
- [x] Support deflated performance evaluation as a research capability (see 49.5): correct Sharpe-ratio-type estimates for the number of trials, non-normal returns, and sample length before comparing strategies.
- [x] Where statistically justifiable, offer probabilistic statements about metrics (e.g., probabilistic Sharpe Ratio) instead of single-point values; label them as model-based estimates with their assumptions.

### 43.2 Statistical significance

- [x] Significance tests must only be applied when their assumptions are valid.
- [x] The application must warn when sample sizes are too small for a given test.
- [x] The application must warn about multiple-testing problems when many strategies or parameters are compared.
- [x] Never promise “significance” when the statistical assumptions are not satisfied.
- [x] Report effect size and uncertainty alongside any p-value where appropriate.
- [x] Prefer confidence intervals or bootstrap ranges over binary “significant / not significant” verdicts where practical.

### 43.3 Correlation and dependence

- [x] Check for autocorrelation in returns.
- [ ] Check for dependence between trades.
- [ ] Check for overlapping trade effects.
- [ ] Document the implications of dependence for statistical conclusions.

### 43.4 Distribution analysis

- [x] Plot and summarize return and trade distributions.
- [x] Compare observed distributions with appropriate reference distributions only when justified.
- [x] Do not assume normality without checking.
- [x] Explain heavy tails and skewness in plain language.

### 43.5 Interface and honesty

- [x] Every statistical analysis must include its assumptions and limitations.
- [ ] The interface must not present statistical tools as “proof of profitability”.
- [x] Statistical analyses are research features, not trading-signal generators.

---

## [x] 44. Robustness and sensitivity analysis

Robustness answers:

> **Does the result still exist when we change the conditions?**

Optimization (Chapter 39) finds configurations that worked on given data; robustness checks whether the result persists under changed conditions. Do not mix both responsibilities.

### 44.1 Robustness methods

The system must support:

- [x] parameter perturbation; (`perturb_sma_crossover`)
- [x] Monte Carlo simulation (see 44.4); (`monte_carlo_trades`)
- [x] bootstrap; (trade-level bootstrap inside the Monte Carlo runner)
- [ ] randomized execution; — pending (needs a fill-uncertainty model)
- [x] slippage variation; (`sweep_costs`)
- [x] fee variation; (`sweep_costs`)
- [ ] market variation; — pending (dataset variations)
- [x] out-of-sample degradation analysis; (`out_of_sample_degradation`)
- [x] sensitivity analysis.

### 44.2 Parameter perturbation

- [x] Perturb each parameter within a documented neighborhood. (±20% grid, explicated in the code)
- [x] Show how metrics change when parameters move away from the optimized values.
- [x] Identify parameter regions where performance collapses. (`collapsed` flag at <50% of the reference return)
- [x] Compare perturbed results against the optimized result. (`delta_vs_reference`)

### 44.3 Sensitivity analysis

- [x] Vary one factor at a time where appropriate. (cost multiplier sweep)
- [ ] Vary combinations of factors where practical. — pending
- [x] Sweep trading-cost assumptions (fees, slippage, spread). (`sweep_costs`)
- [ ] Sweep execution assumptions (latency, fill rate). — pending (needs randomized execution, 44.6)
- [ ] Sweep dataset variations (time ranges, markets) where appropriate. — pending
- [x] Present results as ranges or heatmaps, not single numbers. (sweeps return scenario rows, never a single point)

### 44.4 Monte Carlo simulation

Monte Carlo must clearly explain **what is being simulated**.

Supported modes may include:

- [x] reshuffling of trade sequences where statistically justifiable; (resampling with replacement)
- [x] bootstrap resampling of trades;
- [x] variation of results under alternative trade sequences;
- [ ] randomized slippage and fees; — pending (needs randomized execution, 44.6)
- [ ] execution uncertainty; — pending (44.6)
- [x] drawdown distributions; (p50/p95 of per-scenario max drawdown)
- [x] risk-of-ruin estimates (see Chapter 60). (fraction of scenarios hitting 50% capital)

Requirements:

- [x] The scenario definition must be explicit and documented. (`MonteCarloConfig`)
- [x] The random seed must be recorded. (`MonteCarloReport.seed`, deterministic)
- [x] The number of scenarios must be recorded.
- [x] The distribution of outcomes must be shown, not only the average. (percentile reports)
- [x] Confidence ranges must be labeled as estimates under the stated assumptions.
- [x] Warn when reshuffling destroys the temporal structure of the data and therefore may not be statistically justifiable.
- [x] Never present Monte Carlo as a prediction of the future. (both warnings are mandatory in every report)

### 44.5 Bootstrap

- [x] Support bootstrap resampling where statistically appropriate. (with-replacement trade resampling)
- [ ] Support block bootstrap for dependent data; document the block scheme and block length. — pending
- [ ] Report bootstrap confidence intervals with their assumptions. — percentiles land via 44.4's Monte Carlo report; formal CIs pending
- [ ] Warn when independence assumptions are violated. — pending

### 44.6 Randomized execution

- [ ] Support randomized execution simulations to test execution sensitivity. — pending
- [ ] Record the random seed and distribution used. — pending
- [ ] Compare execution-sensitive metrics across scenarios. — pending

### 44.7 Out-of-sample degradation

- [x] Compare in-sample, validation, and out-of-sample performance. (`out_of_sample_degradation`)
- [x] Quantify performance degradation between periods. (degradation = 1 − oos/train)
- [x] Flag strategies whose out-of-sample performance collapses.

### 44.8 Backtest overfitting probability (research)

The system may support estimation of the probability that a selected configuration is overfit (see 49.6):

- [ ] combinatorial cross-validation on the same data used for selection, comparing in-sample against symmetric out-of-sample performance;
- [ ] the probability of backtest overfitting (PBO) must always be reported together with the number of trials and the selection method;
- [ ] a high PBO must visibly degrade the evidence level of the result (see Chapter 43.1);
- [ ] explain in beginner terms: "how often would random pickers among these candidates have looked this good?";
- [ ] never present PBO as an exact probability of future failure — it is an estimate under stated assumptions.

### 44.9 Robustness report

- [x] Produce a robustness report summarizing all tests. (`compute_robustness_report`)
- [x] Include assumptions, seeds, and scenario counts.
- [ ] Feed results into strategy qualification (see Chapter 66). — pending

---

## [x] 45. Walk-forward analysis

Walk-forward must be clearly separated from a simple training/validation/test split (Chapter 38).

It must allow:

```text
Train
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Forward Test
   ↓
Move Window
   ↓
Train
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Forward Test
```

### 45.1 Requirements

- [x] Define rolling training windows.
- [ ] Define validation windows. — the current walker selects parameters
  on the training window and tests on the forward window; a separate
  validation stage inside each window is pending.
- [x] Define forward test windows.
- [x] Define the window step size.
- [x] Record every window. (`WindowResult` per window)
- [x] Prevent information from later windows entering earlier windows. (engine no-look-ahead + forward-only window generation)
- [x] Respect indicator warm-up periods at each window boundary. (borrow-only warm-up prefixes, boundaries stay exact)
- [x] Aggregate results across walk-forward periods. (compounded unit-stake aggregate, method documented)
- [x] Allow inspection of each individual period.
- [x] Show the distribution of per-window results, not only the aggregate. (`test_returns` per-window distribution)
- [x] Report the number of windows and their time coverage. (window count + exact boundaries per window)
- [x] Record the exact parameters selected per window.
- [x] Flag windows where the strategy degraded materially. (`degraded` flag, documented threshold)

### 45.2 Reproducibility

- [x] Record dataset version, strategy version, window configuration, and seed. (`WalkForwardReport` metadata; no randomness is used — recorded as such)
- [x] Re-running walk-forward with identical inputs must produce identical results. (tested determinism)

### 45.3 Combinatorial purged cross-validation (research)

Walk-forward uses one chronological path through history. As an optional research capability, the system may support combinatorial purged cross-validation (CPCV, see 49.4):

- [ ] generate multiple train/test combinations over the same historical period instead of a single path;
- [ ] apply purging and embargo (see 38.8) at every boundary;
- [ ] report the distribution of results across paths, not only the mean;
- [ ] record the combination scheme and the number of paths;
- [ ] explain that CPCV produces many more backtest paths from the same data, which raises re-use concerns that must be disclosed;
- [ ] CPCV complements, but does not replace, walk-forward and a final untouched out-of-sample period (Chapter 38.4).

### 45.4 Interpretation

- [x] Never present aggregate walk-forward results as proof of future profitability. (every report carries `WALK_FORWARD_NOTE`)
- [x] Explain that walk-forward reduces, but does not eliminate, overfitting risk.
- [ ] Feed walk-forward results into strategy qualification (see Chapter 66). — pending: qualification pipeline does not exist yet.

---

## [x] 46. Market regime analysis

Regime analysis studies different market conditions. It must not assume that regimes can be identified perfectly.

The system must support the analysis of:

- [x] trending; (`detect_trending_ranging`)
- [x] ranging; (`detect_trending_ranging`)
- [x] high volatility; (`detect_volatility_regime`)
- [x] low volatility; (`detect_volatility_regime`)
- [ ] high liquidity;
- [ ] low liquidity;
- [ ] bull/bear conditions where appropriate.

### 46.1 Regime detection as a model

- [x] Treat regime detection as a hypothesis/model subject to error. (`REGIME_DETECTION_WARNING`)
- [x] Never present a detected regime as a ground-truth label.
- [x] Document the detection method and its parameters. (`RegimeLabels.method`)
- [ ] Report regime classifications with confidence or uncertainty where practical.

### 46.2 Regime-conditional analysis

- [x] Compute performance metrics per regime where appropriate. (`compute_regime_performance`)
- [ ] Compare strategy behavior across regimes.
- [x] Detect whether a strategy depends on one specific regime.
- [x] Warn when a strategy's historical performance is concentrated in a single regime. (`check_regime_concentration`)
- [ ] Evaluate benchmarks within each regime (see Chapter 42).

### 46.3 Regime changes

- [ ] Detect and visualize regime changes over time.
- [ ] Explain that regime changes can invalidate historical results.
- [ ] Support the comparison of out-of-sample behavior against the dominant regimes of the training period.

### 46.4 Beginner explanation

- [x] Explain what market regimes are in plain language.
- [x] Explain why a strategy that works in one regime may fail in another.
- [x] Explain why regime detection is uncertain.

# PART VIII — FEATURE ENGINEERING, MACHINE LEARNING, AFML, AND ENSEMBLES

---

## [x] 47. Feature engineering

Feature engineering is a research activity that supports machine learning and statistical studies. It is not part of the backtesting engine.

### 47.1 Feature catalog

- [x] Maintain a catalog of features with (`FEATURE_CATALOG`):
  - [x] name;
  - [x] formula/definition;
  - [x] source data;
  - [x] parameters;
  - [x] version;
  - [x] warm-up period;
  - [x] intended interpretation;
  - [x] known limitations.

### 47.2 Feature validation

- [x] Every feature must be computed without look-ahead bias. (all features validated)
- [x] Every feature must be computable at the exact time it is used.
- [x] Features must handle missing data explicitly.
- [x] Feature computation must be reproducible (same input → same output).

### 47.3 Feature leakage prevention

- [x] Never use future information in a feature.
- [ ] Normalize/scale features only on training data (Chapter 48.3)
- [ ] Detect and warn about features containing future observations.
- [ ] Detect and warn about redundant or nearly duplicate features.

### 47.4 Advanced feature families (research)

As optional research capabilities (see Chapter 49), the feature catalog may include:

- [ ] fractionally differentiated series: retain memory while achieving stationarity; the differentiation order `d` must be a recorded, documented parameter;
- [ ] structural-break features (for example CUSUM-style tests) with their parameters documented;
- [ ] information-content features (for example Shannon entropy of return signs or quantized returns) with the quantization scheme documented;
- [ ] every advanced feature must pass the same validation, leakage, and documentation rules as any other feature (47.2–47.3);
- [ ] explain in beginner terms why over-differentiated series lose predictive memory.

### 47.5 Feature documentation

- [x] Document the economic or statistical rationale of each feature. (`FeatureMetadata.interpretation`)
 - [x] Document when and why a feature may break. (`FeatureMetadata.limitations`)
- [ ] Provide a beginner-friendly explanation of feature importance results (see Chapter 48; methods and pitfalls in 49.7).

---

## [x] 48. Machine learning

Machine learning is a research tool, not a magical predictive machine.

- [ ] ML must not be presented as a way to predict the market with certainty.
- [ ] ML is an optional research capability; it must not be required for the MVP.
- [ ] Favor simple models when they provide comparable evidence to complex ones (see Chapter 35).

### 48.1 Scope

- [ ] Feature engineering (Chapter 47).
- [ ] Labels/targets.
- [ ] Leakage prevention.
- [ ] Time-series validation.
- [ ] Walk-forward validation (Chapter 45).
- [ ] Model versioning.
- [ ] Reproducibility.
- [ ] Hyperparameter control.
- [ ] Overfitting detection.
- [ ] Feature importance.
- [ ] Model degradation tracking.
- [ ] Out-of-sample testing.

### 48.2 Labels and targets

- [ ] Labels must be defined explicitly and documented.
- [ ] Labels must not use future information.
- [ ] Label definitions must be versioned.

### 48.3 Validation discipline

- [ ] Use time-series-aware validation, never random shuffling.
- [ ] Use walk-forward validation where appropriate (Chapter 45).
- [ ] Never tune hyperparameters on the out-of-sample period.
- [ ] Record all hyperparameters, seeds, and data splits.

### 48.4 Overfitting control

- [ ] Compare training, validation, and out-of-sample performance.
- [ ] Warn when the gap between training and out-of-sample performance is large.
- [ ] Warn when performance depends on a specific random seed.
- [ ] Prefer simpler models when evidence is comparable.

### 48.5 Model management

- [ ] Every model must be versioned.
- [ ] Every model must record its training dataset version, features, labels, hyperparameters, and software versions.
- [ ] Models must be reproducible from recorded metadata.
- [ ] Track model degradation over time (see Chapter 64).

### 48.6 Interpretation

- [ ] Report feature importance where appropriate.
- [ ] Present importance with uncertainty and caveats.
- [ ] Do not treat feature importance as causal evidence.
- [ ] A model output is a research signal candidate, never an order by itself (see Chapter 33.6).

### 48.7 Advanced ML research capabilities

Advanced, leakage-aware ML techniques are specified in their own chapter (Chapter 49): triple-barrier labeling, sample weighting, meta-labeling, purged cross-validation, and feature-importance methods. Those capabilities are optional research extensions, not MVP requirements, and must follow the same validation discipline as this chapter.

---

## [x] 49. Advanced financial machine learning (AFML)

This chapter consolidates the advanced research techniques from *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (Marcos López de Prado, Wiley, 2018) that the platform may implement. Reference implementations and exercise solutions are available under `external/adv-financial-ml-marcos-exercises`.

These techniques are **research-tier capabilities**: none of them is required for the MVP, none of them may generate orders by itself, and every one of them must obey the evidence rules of Chapter 43 and the leakage rules of Chapters 38 and 48.

- [x] Every technique in this chapter must be verified against the exercise repository (and, where necessary, additional research) before implementation; never implement from memory of the book alone.
- [x] Every technique must record its parameters, versions, seeds, and dataset identity like any other research artifact (Chapters 52–53).
- [ ] The UI must label these features as advanced research tools with their assumptions and limitations visible.

### 49.1 Event-based bars and monetary sampling

Canonical specification for the bar types introduced in 29.1:

- [ ] volume bars: sample after a fixed traded volume;
- [ ] dollar bars: sample after a fixed traded value;
- [ ] imbalance bars: sample after a directional-imbalance threshold, only where trade-level data is available;
- [ ] document why event-based bars often stabilize variance compared with fixed-time candles;
- [ ] bar thresholds and parameters must be recorded and versioned;
- [ ] study the exercises' reference implementation of bars before implementing.

### 49.2 Triple-barrier labeling

Labels must describe the trading decision, not just the next price change.

- [x] define two horizontal barriers: take-profit and stop-loss. (`TripleBarrierConfig`)
- [x] define a vertical (time) barrier: the maximum holding period. (`TripleBarrierConfig`)
- [x] the label is which barrier is touched first. (`TripleBarrierLabel.barrier_hit`)
- [x] barrier distances and the time barrier are explicit, documented parameters. (`TripleBarrierConfig`)
- [ ] barrier evaluation must respect intrabar ambiguity rules (see 37.5) and must state whether the high/low path or close-only paths are used;
- [x] labels are computed without look-ahead. (all features validated)
- [ ] explain in beginner terms what the three barriers mean.

### 49.3 Sample weighting and uniqueness

Consecutive overlapping positions make observations non-independent and must not be treated as equal:

- [x] compute average uniqueness of each labeled observation based on overlap. (`compute_label_uniqueness`)
- [ ] weight observations by uniqueness and by return magnitude where appropriate.
- [x] record the weighting scheme as part of the model/experiment metadata.
- [ ] warn when many labels share the same time intervals because effective sample size is then much smaller than the nominal count.

### 49.4 Purged K-Fold cross-validation and embargo (canonical)

This subsection owns the canonical requirements; 38.8 and 45.3 reference it.

- [x] implement purging. (`create_purged_splits`)
- [x] implement embargo. (`PurgedKFoldConfig.embargo_pct`)
- [x] embargo length is an explicit parameter, recorded with the experiment.
- [ ] provide combinatorial split generation for CPCV (used by 45.3);
- [ ] warn when applied to labels that do not overlap but features are highly serially dependent;
- [ ] never present a purged-CV score as a substitute for a true untouched out-of-sample test.

### 49.5 Probabilistic and deflated Sharpe ratios

Support rigorous evaluation of Sharpe-ratio-type metrics as research capabilities:

- [x] probabilistic Sharpe ratio (PSR). (`probabilistic_sharpe_ratio`)
- [ ] deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR)
- [ ] the number of trials must be recorded wherever DSR is computed — an experiment that cannot count its trials cannot claim a deflated estimate;
- [ ] both estimates must be labeled as model-based with their assumptions (non-normality, independence) visible;
- [ ] feed both into the evidence levels of Chapter 43.1 and into strategy qualification (Chapter 66).

### 49.6 Probability of backtest overfitting (PBO)

Canonical specification for 44.8:

- [ ] implement combinatorially symmetric cross-validation (CSCV) to estimate PBO for a set of candidate configurations;
- [ ] report PBO next to any optimization or selection result that used multiple trials (see Chapter 39);
- [ ] a high PBO must be displayed as a prominent warning and must lower the evidence level of the result;
- [ ] document the rank-logit/combinatorial method actually implemented;
- [ ] never present PBO as an exact prediction — it is an estimate under stated assumptions.

### 49.7 Feature-importance methods

Complement Chapter 48.6 with techniques that respect temporal dependence:

- [ ] mean-decrease accuracy via purged/embargoed cross-validation (not plain K-Fold);
- [ ] mean-decrease impurity for tree ensembles, reported with the same caveats;
- [ ] document that clustered features (highly correlated groups) distort single-feature importance and report clustered importance where practical;
- [ ] never interpret importance as causal evidence;
- [ ] explain in beginner terms what feature importance can and cannot say.

### 49.8 Meta-labeling

Meta-labeling is a research capability that filters an existing primary signal instead of generating one:

- [ ] the primary strategy produces the directional signal exactly as specified in Chapter 33.6;
- [ ] a secondary model predicts whether the primary signal is likely to succeed, using features that contain no future information;
- [ ] labels for the secondary model must come from triple-barrier outcomes (49.2), not from arbitrary future returns;
- [ ] evaluate the primary strategy alone, the filtered version alone, and the filter's marginal contribution;
- [ ] meta-labeling must never bypass the signal → order separation of 33.6, and its output is still only a research signal candidate;
- [ ] bet sizing derived from model probabilities is a research study that must satisfy the risk limits of Chapter 58 before it can ever inform anything operational.

### 49.9 Research code references

- [ ] Map each implemented technique to its exercise-repository reference and record the mapping in `docs/en/developers/reference-projects.md`;
- [ ] review any adapted code for correctness against the book's definitions before merging;
- [ ] the printed book is the conceptual authority for disputes between implementations; it must be cited in documentation but never redistributed.

### 49.10 Implementation guardrails

- [ ] These capabilities must not be required by any other MVP chapter; chapters that reference them must mark the dependency as research-tier.
- [ ] A failure or unavailability of these features must never block backtesting, optimization, paper trading, or risk management.
- [ ] All advanced features must be clearly separated in the UI from beginner workflows.

---

### 50.2 Ensemble validation

- [ ] Validate the ensemble with the same discipline as individual strategies (out-of-sample, walk-forward, robustness).
- [ ] Check that the ensemble does not concentrate risk in one regime (see Chapter 46).
- [ ] Never present ensemble performance as proof of future profitability.

---

## [x] 53. Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a core research requirement, not an optional feature.

---

## [x] 57. Paper trading

Paper trading must use real-time or replayed market data while using simulated money.

The purpose is to test the complete trading workflow without risking real capital.

### 57.1 Account simulation

The paper account must model:

# PART XII — RISK AND CAPITAL PROTECTION

---

## [x] 58. Risk manager

* [ ] Excessive volatility.
* [ ] Excessive spread.
* [ ] Insufficient liquidity.
* [ ] Time-synchronization errors.
* [ ] Inconsistent balances.
* [ ] Invalid market metadata.

### 58.5 System-state protections

The `RiskManager` must be able to reject orders when:

* [ ] The emergency kill switch is active (see Chapter 58).
* [ ] The selected trading environment is invalid.
* [ ] Required credentials are unavailable.
* [ ] Account state cannot be verified.
* [ ] Market data is considered unsafe.
* [ ] The execution engine reports an unsafe state.

### 58.6 Profiles

Include:

* [ ] Conservative.
* [ ] Moderate.
* [ ] Custom.

* [ ] Do not include an “Aggressive” profile in the first version.

### 58.7 Decision result

The `RiskManager` must return a structured result containing:

* [ ] Approved.
* [ ] Rejected.
* [ ] Modified.
* [ ] Reason.
* [ ] Triggered rule.
* [ ] Permitted size.
* [ ] Timestamp.
* [ ] Audit identifier.
* [ ] Beginner-friendly explanation.

### 58.8 Strategy isolation

* [ ] A strategy must never bypass the `RiskManager`.
* [ ] A strategy must never disable a risk rule.
* [ ] A strategy must never modify global risk limits.
* [ ] Imported strategies must inherit the active risk configuration.
* [ ] Real trading must always pass through the same central risk layer.

### 58.9 Risk calculations

* [ ] Final decision.
* [ ] Reason.
* [ ] Risk-manager version.

### 58.11 Education

Every risk rule must include beginner documentation explaining:

* [ ] What the rule does.
* [ ] Why it exists.
* [ ] What problem it attempts to prevent.
* [ ] What happens when it is triggered.
* [ ] Its limitations.

---

## [x] 59. Emergency kill switch

Implement a visible, accessible, and clearly identifiable emergency kill switch.

The kill switch must be designed as a **capital-protection mechanism**, not merely as a user-interface feature.

### 59.1 When activated

* [ ] No new orders may be created.
* [ ] Automatic strategies must stop generating executable orders.
* [ ] Pending internal trading tasks must be cancelled where safely possible.
* [ ] New order requests must be rejected by the central risk/execution layer.
* [ ] The application must clearly display the emergency state.
* [ ] The event must be logged.
* [ ] An audit identifier must be created.
* [ ] The activation timestamp must be recorded.

### 59.2 Exchange orders

The kill switch must distinguish between:

```text
Local application state
        and
Orders already accepted by the exchange
```

Therefore:

* [ ] Open exchange orders must not be cancelled automatically by default.
* [ ] Automatic cancellation may be implemented as an explicit configurable policy.
* [ ] Any automatic cancellation policy must require additional confirmation during configuration.
* [ ] The application must clearly inform the user whether exchange orders remain active.

### 59.3 Activation sources

Support:

* [ ] GUI button.
* [ ] Configurable keyboard shortcut.
* [ ] Programmatic activation by the risk system.
* [ ] Automatic activation when configured critical safety conditions are triggered.

### 59.4 Recovery

To deactivate the kill switch:

* [ ] Require explicit user action.
* [ ] Display the reason for activation.
* [ ] Display current account and market state.
* [ ] Revalidate connectivity.
* [ ] Revalidate balances.
* [ ] Revalidate market-data freshness.
* [ ] Revalidate risk limits.
* [ ] Require confirmation before resuming automated trading.

### 59.5 Logging

Record:

* [ ] Activation timestamp.
* [ ] Deactivation timestamp.
* [ ] Activation source.
* [ ] Reason.
* [ ] Active strategy.
* [ ] Account/environment.
* [ ] Open positions.
* [ ] Pending orders known by the application.
* [ ] Result of any cancellation attempt.

### 59.6 Beginner explanation

Explain:

* [ ] What the kill switch does.
* [ ] When it should be used.
* [ ] What it does not do.
* [ ] Why exchange orders may remain active.
* [ ] Why the user must verify the account after an emergency.
* [ ] Why stopping new orders is not necessarily the same as closing positions.

## [x] 60. Risk of ruin and capital depletion

The system must differentiate:

- [ ] maximum historical drawdown;
- [ ] expected drawdown;
- [ ] probability of ruin;
- [ ] capital depletion;
- [ ] position sizing.

### 60.1 Definitions

- [ ] **Maximum historical drawdown**: the largest peak-to-trough decline observed in the analyzed period.
- [ ] **Expected drawdown**: an estimate of drawdown under stated assumptions.
- [ ] **Probability of ruin**: an estimate of the probability that capital falls below a defined threshold.
- [ ] **Capital depletion**: the point at which trading cannot continue because capital is exhausted or restricted.
- [ ] **Position sizing**: the rule that determines how much capital a trade risks.

### 60.2 Estimation discipline

- [ ] Never present a risk-of-ruin estimate as mathematical certainty if its assumptions are not valid.
- [ ] Document all assumptions (distribution, independence, costs, sample size).
- [ ] Prefer ranges or scenario distributions over single numbers.
- [ ] Use Monte Carlo and bootstrap methods where appropriate (see Chapter 44).
- [ ] Warn when estimates depend on unrealistically favorable assumptions.
- [ ] Risk-of-ruin estimates are research/risk-analysis outputs; they must never be the only basis for an order.

---

## [x] 61. Capital protection

The system must adopt the principle:

> **Capital preservation takes priority over strategy execution.**

A strategy must never be able to ignore:

- [ ] risk limits;
- [ ] kill switch;
- [ ] exposure limits;
- [ ] account restrictions;
- [ ] safety gates.

### 61.1 Enforcement

- [ ] The risk manager enforces capital-protection rules for every environment (see Chapter 58).
- [ ] The kill switch remains available in every environment (see Chapter 58).
- [x] Safety gates verify capital-protection conditions before real orders. (`SafetyGates`)
- [x] Safety gates are non-bypassable. (`SAFETY_GATES_WARNING`)
- [ ] Capital-protection rule changes require explicit user action and are audited.

### 61.2 Education

- [ ] Explain why capital preservation comes first.
- [ ] Explain that drawdowns are harder to recover from as they grow.
- [ ] Explain the relationship between position sizing, drawdown, and risk of ruin (see Chapter 60).

### 61.3 Protection of essential funds

- [ ] Before enabling real trading, the user must confirm that they are not using essential funds (money needed for living expenses, rent, food, or emergencies).
- [ ] The application must warn when a user's stated risk capacity suggests financial hardship.
- [ ] The application must recommend paper trading only for users who cannot afford losses.
- [ ] The application must never offer credit, leverage, or margin as a "solution" (see Chapter 5).
- [ ] The application must provide clear guidance on how to stop trading and walk away.

# PART XIII — MONITORING AND STRATEGY LIFECYCLE

---

## [x] 62. Live monitoring

Live monitoring covers paper trading, testnet, and real trading sessions.

### 62.1 Monitored state

Display:

- [ ] current portfolio value;
- [ ] open positions;
- [ ] pending orders;
- [ ] executed orders;
- [ ] fees;
- [x] slippage.
- [ ] drawdown;
- [ ] exposure;
- [ ] risk-manager decisions;
- [ ] connection state;
- [ ] data freshness;
- [ ] environment indicator (always visible);
- [ ] kill-switch status;
- [ ] recent alerts.

### 62.2 Monitoring rules

- [ ] The environment (backtest, paper, testnet, real) must be visible at all times.
- [ ] Alerts must be understandable to a beginner.
- [ ] Alerts must not depend only on color.
- [ ] Monitoring must never bypass the risk manager.

### 62.3 Historical comparisons

- [ ] Compare live behavior against backtest expectations where appropriate (see Chapter 63).
- [ ] Compare live behavior against paper-trading behavior.

---

## [x] 63. Live vs backtest drift

The system must explain and quantify differences between:

- [x] backtest expectations. (tracked in backtest results)
- [x] paper-trading behavior. (tracked via paper trading)
- [ ] live behavior.

### 63.1 Drift dimensions

Analyze:

- [x] return drift. (computed from backtest vs paper)
- [x] drawdown drift. (computed from backtest vs paper)
- [x] slippage drift. (computed from model vs actual)
- [x] fill-rate drift. (computed from expected vs actual)
- [ ] latency drift;
- [ ] volatility drift;
- [ ] market-regime changes (see Chapter 46).

### 63.2 Drift reporting

- [ ] Compare realized metrics against expected ranges from the backtest.
- [ ] Show drift over time, not only as a single value.
- [ ] Explain likely causes for each drift dimension.
- [ ] Distinguish expected variability from meaningful degradation.
- [ ] The system must be able to mark a strategy as degraded or suspicious (see Chapter 64).

### 63.3 Education

- [ ] Explain why backtest, paper, and live results will never match exactly.
- [ ] Explain which differences are normal and which are warning signs.

---

## [x] 64. Strategy failure detection

The system must detect when a strategy stops behaving as it did historically.

### 64.1 Detection signals

Consider:

- [ ] performance degradation;
- [ ] drawdown increase;
- [ ] trade-distribution changes;
- [ ] volatility changes;
- [ ] execution degradation;
- [ ] regime changes;
- [ ] data-quality problems.

### 64.2 Recommendations

The system must be able to recommend:

```text
Continue
Monitor
Reduce exposure
Pause
Retire
```

- [ ] Every recommendation must show the reason.
- [ ] Never hide the reason behind a recommendation.
- [ ] Recommendations must be based on recorded evidence, not guesses.
- [ ] Recommendations must never bypass the risk manager.
- [ ] A “Retire” recommendation must update the strategy registry status (see Chapter 36).
- [ ] Recommendations must include the data and thresholds used.

### 64.3 Education

- [ ] Explain why strategies degrade over time.
- [ ] Explain that past performance does not guarantee continued performance.
- [ ] Explain the difference between normal variability and genuine failure.

---

## [x] 65. Strategy promotion pipeline

A strategy must progress through explicit stages. It must never jump directly from `Backtest → Real Trading`.

The progression is:

```text
Idea
 ↓
Prototype
 ↓
Backtest
 ↓
Validation
 ↓
Out-of-Sample
 ↓
Robustness
 ↓
Walk-Forward
 ↓
Paper Trading
 ↓
Qualification
 ↓
Safety Gates
 ↓
Small Live Deployment
 ↓
Monitoring
```

### 65.1 Stage requirements

- [x] Each stage requires the completion of the previous stage.
- [x] Each stage transition must be recorded with timestamp and evidence reference.
- [ ] The strategy registry must reflect the current stage (see Chapter 36).
- [ ] A strategy may return to an earlier stage when new evidence contradicts its current status.
- [ ] Skipping stages must be impossible by default.
- [ ] Any exception must require explicit, audited user confirmation.

### 65.2 Promotion evidence

- [ ] Promotion to `Paper Trading` requires backtest, validation, out-of-sample, robustness, and walk-forward evidence.
- [ ] Promotion to `Qualification` requires paper-trading evidence.
- [ ] Promotion to `Small Live Deployment` requires a positive qualification report (see Chapter 66).
- [ ] Live deployment must start with limited exposure and be monitored (see Chapter 62).

---

## [x] 66. Strategy qualification

Qualification is a formal evaluation stage. A strategy must not be considered “qualified” merely because `Profit > 0`.

### 66.1 Evaluation criteria

The qualification process must consider, where applicable:

- [ ] out-of-sample performance;
- [ ] drawdown;
- [ ] risk-adjusted metrics;
- [ ] benchmark comparison (see Chapter 42);
- [ ] sample size;
- [ ] parameter stability (see Chapter 39);
- [ ] robustness (see Chapter 44);
- [ ] walk-forward (see Chapter 45);
- [ ] paper trading (see Chapter 57);
- [ ] execution realism (see Chapter 56);
- [ ] data quality (see Chapter 29);
- [ ] complexity (see Chapter 35);
- [ ] statistical evidence (see Chapter 43);
- [ ] operational stability (see Chapter 62).

### 66.2 Qualification outcomes

Qualification must produce one of:

```text
Qualified
Conditionally Qualified
Not Qualified
```

- [ ] “Conditionally Qualified” must list the conditions and their deadlines or thresholds.
- [ ] “Not Qualified” must explain which criteria failed and why.
- [ ] Qualification reports must be stored and referenced from the strategy registry (see Chapter 36).
- [ ] Qualification is not a guarantee of future profitability.

### 66.3 Qualification review

- [ ] A qualified strategy must be re-qualified after material changes (parameters, data, execution model, market conditions).
- [ ] Re-qualification intervals must be documented.

---

# PART XIV — SAFETY GATES AND REAL TRADING

---

## [x] 67. Safety gates

Safety gates are the executable protection layer between the application and a real exchange.

> **Capital preservation takes priority over strategy execution** (see Chapter 61).

Before an order reaches a real exchange:

```text
Strategy
   ↓
Signal
   ↓
Portfolio State
   ↓
Risk Manager
   ↓
Safety Gates
   ↓
Execution Engine
   ↓
Exchange
```

The safety layer must verify:

- [ ] Correct environment.
- [ ] Correct exchange.
- [ ] Correct account.
- [ ] Current balances.
- [ ] Current market data.
- [ ] Valid order parameters.
- [ ] Valid market constraints.
- [ ] Risk limits.
- [ ] Position limits.
- [ ] Exposure limits.
- [ ] Kill-switch state.
- [ ] Connection state.

### 67.1 Safety-gate rules

- [ ] A strategy can never disable a safety gate.
- [ ] Safety gates must be verified on every order, not only on the first order.
- [ ] Safety-gate failures must be audited with reason and timestamp.
- [ ] Safety-gate configuration changes require explicit user confirmation.
- [ ] The application must never silently disable a safety gate.

### 67.2 Environment separation

- [ ] Environments are: `Backtest`, `Historical Replay`, `Paper Trading`, `Exchange Testnet`, `Real Trading`.
- [ ] The environment must be visible at all times.
- [ ] Switching from testnet/paper to real trading must require explicit confirmation.
- [ ] Importing a configuration must never silently switch environments.

---

## [x] 68. Real trading

Real trading support must remain behind multiple independent safety protections.

The MVP may keep real trading completely disabled through a feature flag.

Real trading must never become active simply because an API key or exchange configuration was imported.

### 68.1 Activation requirements

A future real-trading activation flow must require:

- [ ] 1. Enabling an explicit advanced option.
- [ ] 2. Displaying a prominent risk warning.
- [ ] 3. Requiring written confirmation.
- [ ] 4. Confirming that the API key has no withdrawal permission.
- [ ] 5. Checking the selected environment.
- [ ] 6. Displaying the selected exchange.
- [ ] 7. Displaying the selected account/environment.
- [ ] 8. Configuring strict risk limits.
- [ ] 9. Testing connectivity.
- [ ] 10. Verifying account balances.
- [ ] 11. Verifying market-data freshness.
- [ ] 12. Verifying system time synchronization.
- [ ] 13. Confirming the emergency kill switch configuration.
- [ ] 14. Requiring a confirmation phrase.
- [ ] 15. Permanently displaying a clear `REAL TRADING` indicator while active.

### 68.2 API credentials

- [ ] Never store withdrawal-enabled credentials by default.
- [ ] Recommend API keys without withdrawal permissions.
- [ ] Store credentials using the platform's secure credential mechanism where available.
- [ ] Never display complete credentials in logs.
- [ ] Never include credentials in strategy files.
- [ ] Never include credentials in exported reports.
- [ ] Never include credentials in screenshots or diagnostic bundles.

### 68.3 Strategy restrictions

- [ ] Real trading strategies must use the same signal/risk/execution architecture.
- [ ] Strategies must never modify risk limits.
- [ ] Strategies must never bypass the `RiskManager`.
- [ ] Strategies must never access credentials directly.
- [ ] Strategies must never select a real account automatically.

### 68.4 Testing restrictions

- [ ] Never use a real account in automated tests.
- [ ] Never send real orders from unit tests.
- [ ] Never enable real trading automatically.
- [ ] Never use real credentials in test fixtures.
- [ ] Never require real credentials for CI.
- [ ] Test real-trading logic against mocks, simulators, or testnet environments.

### 68.5 Monitoring

While real trading is active, display:

- [ ] `REAL TRADING` status.
- [ ] Exchange.
- [ ] Account/environment.
- [ ] Current balance.
- [ ] Available balance.
- [ ] Open positions.
- [ ] Open orders.
- [ ] Exposure.
- [ ] Current drawdown.
- [ ] Risk limits.
- [ ] Connection state.
- [ ] Market-data freshness.
- [ ] Recent executions.
- [ ] Recent risk decisions.
- [ ] Emergency kill-switch status.

### 68.6 Failure handling

If a critical safety condition occurs:

- [ ] Stop creating new orders.
- [ ] Notify the user clearly.
- [ ] Log the event.
- [ ] Activate the appropriate risk protection.
- [ ] Preserve the audit trail.
- [ ] Do not silently continue trading.

### 68.7 Beginner protection

The beginner documentation must strongly recommend:

1. [ ] Learning the fundamentals.
2. [ ] Testing strategies historically.
3. [ ] Using out-of-sample evaluation.
4. [ ] Testing strategy robustness.
5. [ ] Paper trading.
6. [ ] Using testnet where supported.
7. [ ] Starting with very limited exposure if the user eventually chooses to trade real funds.

The application must clearly state:

> **Real trading involves the possibility of losing money. Historical performance, backtesting, paper trading, or statistical analysis cannot guarantee future profits.**

---

# PART XV — DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND ETHICS

---

## [x] 69. Development phases

- [ ] Do not try to implement the entire application in one change.

---

## [x] 70. Working method

Before modifying files:

- [ ] 1. inspect the repository;
- [ ] 2. report what was found;
- [ ] 3. list the files that will be created or changed;
- [ ] 4. briefly explain the objective;
- [ ] 5. make small changes;
- [ ] 6. run tests;
- [ ] 7. show the results;
- [ ] 8. fix failures;
- [ ] 9. update documentation;
- [ ] 10. update translations where visible strings changed.

- [ ] Do not replace entire files unnecessarily.
- [ ] Do not hide errors.
- [x] Do not claim that a test passed unless it was actually executed.

When a required tool is unavailable:

- [ ] state that clearly;
- [ ] provide the command the developer must run;
- [ ] do not pretend the action succeeded.

When a dependency must be installed (chapter 4.0):

- [ ] STOP development at that task;
- [ ] notify the developer with the package name, source (Debian or PyPI), reason, and exact install command;
- [ ] wait for the developer to install it (via `apt`, or via a venv for PyPI-only packages);
- [ ] never install packages or create virtual environments on your own.

Every completed feature must include:

- [ ] code;
- [ ] tests;
- [x] English documentation. (`docs/en/developers/`)
- [ ] translation-ready strings;
- [ ] Spanish translation where feasible;
- [ ] beginner-oriented explanation when the feature affects end users.

---

## [x] 71. First concrete task and expected result

### 71.1 First concrete task

- [x] Begin only with Phase 0 and the minimum foundation of Phase 1.

Perform these tasks:

- [x] 1. inspect the development environment.

The initial application must open a window containing:

- [x] the name “Crypto Trading Lab”;
- [x] a File menu;
- [x] a View menu;
- [x] a Tools menu;
- [x] a Help menu;
- [x] a language selector;

- [x] a button to load a CSV file;
- [x] a button to open the Backtesting Lab, initially disabled;
- [x] a button to open the Learning Center;
- [x] a link to “Start Here: Cryptocurrency for Complete Beginners.”

- [x] The first English beginner guide must be `docs/en/beginners/00-start-here.md`

It must explain:

- [x] what Crypto Trading Lab is;
- [x] what it is not;
- [x] that profits are not guaranteed;
- [x] that paper trading is the default;
- [x] where a complete beginner should begin;
- [x] how to open the Learning Center;
- [x] why real money should not be used while learning.

- [x] The first glossary file must be `docs/en/beginners/glossary.md`

It must initially define at least:

- [x] strategy.
- [x] backtesting.
- [x] paper trading.
- [x] risk;
- [ ] drawdown.

### 71.2 Expected result of the first iteration

At the end, provide:

- [ ] 1. architecture summary;
- [ ] 2. project file tree;

- [ ] Do not implement real-money operations yet.
- [ ] Do not include example keys that look real.
- [ ] Do not use real funds.
- [ ] Do not claim that Crypto Trading Lab can guarantee profits.
- [ ] Do not leave beginner documentation until the end of the project.
- [ ] Documentation, translation, education, tests, and code must evolve together.

---

## [x] 72. Research ethics and honest reporting

The project must maintain scientific and professional honesty at every stage.

### 72.1 Honest evidence

- [ ] Never present a backtest as proof of future profitability.
- [ ] Never present Monte Carlo, bootstrap, or statistical results as predictions of the future.
- [ ] Never hide assumptions behind results.
- [ ] Never cherry-pick time periods, parameters, or datasets to make a result look better.
- [ ] Always label evidence level: observed result, statistical evidence, research hypothesis, validated evidence (see Chapter 43).
- [ ] Report failed experiments as faithfully as successful ones.

### 72.2 Warnings and disclaimers

- [ ] All warnings must be understandable to a complete beginner.
- [ ] The application must explain the risks of cryptocurrency trading.
- [ ] The application must explain that users can lose part or all of their capital.
- [ ] The application must explain that most retail traders lose money and that trading is not a reliable income source.
- [ ] The application must not present itself as a solution to financial hardship.
- [ ] The application must not provide financial advice.

### 72.3 Scientific discipline

- [ ] Favor simpler explanations when they fit the evidence (see Chapter 35).
- [ ] Document uncertainty instead of hiding it.
- [ ] The interface must never present statistical tools as “proof of profitability”.
- [ ] Research automation must never run real operations (see Chapter 52).
- [ ] The AI assistant must never be presented as an oracle (see Chapter 55).

### 72.4 Educational responsibility

- [ ] Explain why backtests can be misleading.
- [ ] Explain why profits are never guaranteed.
- [ ] Explain why paper trading differs from real trading.
- [ ] Keep education separate from financial advice.

---

# Final verification note

This roadmap is complete when the following architectural checks hold:

- [x] The conceptual flow `FOUNDATION → DATA → MARKET MODEL → STRATEGIES → SIGNALS → BACKTESTING → DATA SPLITTING → OPTIMIZATION → PERFORMANCE → STATISTICAL RESEARCH → ROBUSTNESS → WALK-FORWARD → REGIME ANALYSIS → FEATURE ENGINEERING → MACHINE LEARNING → ADVANCED FINANCIAL ML → ENSEMBLES → PORTFOLIO → EXECUTION → PAPER TRADING → RISK → MONITORING → STRATEGY QUALIFICATION → SAFETY GATES → REAL TRADING` is respected.
- [x] Research, execution, and risk responsibilities are separated (see Chapter 6.1).
- [x] No feature appears twice with different owners.
- [x] Every cross-reference points to a chapter that exists.
- [x] Every chapter answers a concrete question.
- [x] Terminology is consistent (see Chapter 2).
- [x] A profitable backtest is never presented as evidence of future advantage.

---

# PART XVI — RESEARCH WORKFLOW (2026-09-19 improvements)

This part specifies the work requested by
`8vo/08-mejoras-para-crypto-trading-lab.md`: turning the existing
scientific engine into a workflow a single person can actually walk
through. It adds requirements only; the chapters above keep their
canonical ownership. Items are marked `[x]` only when they are
implemented **and tested**.

---

## [x] 73. Historical data acquisition and dataset identity

The user must be able to research a market without hunting for a CSV
file first (analysis §3, §8).

- [x] Download historical candles from Binance Spot public REST using
  only the Python standard library — no new dependency.
- [x] Supported timeframes: 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d.
- [x] A request names exchange, symbol, interval, start and end; naive
  datetimes are rejected.
- [x] Pagination with a hard candle cap so a mistaken range cannot
  download forever.
- [x] Downloads are public and never send credentials.
- [x] Validation reports candle count, missing candles, duplicates,
  invalid rows and timeframe-grid alignment (chapter 29).
- [x] Every dataset receives a stable identity
  (`EXCHANGE_SYMBOL_INTERVAL_START_END_Vn`) and a SHA-256 checksum.
- [x] Datasets are persisted with their identity card (chapter 53.2).
- [x] The network transport is injectable, so the test suite never
  touches the internet.
- [x] A beginner-readable explanation is produced on failure and on
  validation problems.
- [ ] Historical download from a second exchange (Coinbase) — pending,
  chapter 26.3.
- [ ] Automatic retry/backoff on transient network errors — pending,
  chapter 27.

---

## [x] 74. Research workflow and validity dashboard

A result must arrive with an explicit statement of how much of the
research protocol was actually completed (analysis §9, §15, §16).

- [x] One service runs hypothesis → strategy → costs → backtest →
  benchmark → out-of-sample → robustness → (optional) walk-forward →
  qualification.
- [x] Every run is deterministic for identical inputs.
- [x] Every run records an experiment with dataset id and checksum,
  parameters, execution assumptions, metrics and conclusion
  (chapter 52).
- [x] A validity checklist reports, per item, pass/fail plus a plain
  explanation: dataset quality, look-ahead protection, train/test
  separation, transaction costs, slippage model, benchmark,
  out-of-sample, walk-forward, Monte Carlo, parameter sensitivity,
  sample size, multiple testing, liquidity realism.
- [x] Liquidity/market impact is reported as **not satisfied** until it
  is genuinely modelled: the laboratory never marks its own homework.
- [x] The number of tested configurations is recorded and triggers a
  multiple-testing warning (chapter 43.1).
- [x] A plain-language verdict never upgrades an observation into
  evidence.
- [x] The validity evidence ladder is shown in the interface.
- [ ] A dedicated experiment-comparison screen — partially done (the
  notebook compares selected experiments).

---

## [x] 75. Observable experiment lifecycle

Experiments must be visible, searchable, taggable and persistent
(analysis §5).

- [x] Statuses: draft, running, completed, failed, cancelled, archived,
  qualified, rejected.
- [x] Rejected experiments are kept, never deleted.
- [x] Every mutation persists to the research directory.
- [x] Search over hypothesis, strategy, dataset, notes and tags.
- [x] Side-by-side comparison with a union of metric keys.
- [x] Export and import of the experiment history as JSON.
- [ ] Queued batch research jobs with progress and cancellation.

---

## [x] 76. Integrated research notebook

The notebook is the trader's scientific record, not a text box
(analysis §6).

- [x] Entries are experiment records: hypothesis, dataset identity and
  checksum, parameters, execution assumptions, metrics and conclusion.
- [x] Research notes can be appended over time.
- [x] Records are searchable and comparable.
- [x] The history can be exported as JSON.
- [ ] Auto-filling the manifest from a completed backtest inside the
  notebook (the wizard records it automatically today).

---

## [x] 77. Honest assistant and strategy rule builder

- [x] The assistant is offline and deterministic by default; it states
  that it is not a generative model.
- [x] A real model backend can be injected without changing the UI; the
  chapter-55 restrictions still apply.
- [x] Assistant conversations are persisted.
- [x] The strategy builder is backed by the real builder module:
  validate, explain, export and import a versioned JSON rule.
- [x] No `eval`/`exec` anywhere in the builder.
- [x] The builder reports when a rule is incomplete (no entry/exit)
  instead of pretending it is tradable.
- [x] Executable rule strategies: builder blocks become a declarative
  `RuleStrategySpec` (`rule_strategy.py`) the engine can run, with no
  `eval`/`exec`; stop-loss/take-profit are evaluated on candle closes
  and the limitation is stated.
- [x] The Backtesting Lab can load a rule JSON and backtest it as a
  custom strategy.
- [x] The builder explains *why* a rule cannot run yet (arithmetic
  operators, filters) instead of guessing.
- [ ] Parameter sweep launched from the builder itself (the Backtesting
  Lab sweep currently supports SMA parameters only).

---

## [x] 78. Complexity and multiple-testing awareness

- [x] Strategy complexity is analysed from the real strategy class and
  shown with its violations and the chapter-35 warning.
- [x] The backtesting lab runs a real parameter sweep over SMA
  fast/slow ranges.
- [x] The sweep states that it is exploration, not validation, and
  counts the configurations tried.
- [x] The optimizer fails loudly when nothing can be evaluated instead

## [ ] 79. Paper trading over real market data and trading journal

The largest remaining gap (analysis §10, §11, §13). Replaying a
downloaded dataset works today; a continuous feed does not.

- [ ] A continuous market-data feed for paper trading (WebSocket).
- [x] Paper orders, fills, fees and slippage against a simulated
  account, replaying real candles (`paper_session.py`).
- [x] The strategy never bypasses the risk manager: every intended order
  is evaluated first and rejections are recorded in the journal.
- [x] A trading journal recording, per trade: strategy, signal, time,
  price, risk decision, simulated fill, slippage, fee, exit, P/L and
  reason (`paper_session.TradeJournal`).
- [x] The journal renders for reading and saves/loads as JSON.
- [x] The paper-trading screen shows the account, the journal and the
  chapter-57 limitation note.
- [x] Beginner guide: `docs/en/beginners/paper-trading.md`.
- [ ] A dedicated post-trade follow-up view (“what did the strategy know
  at the time?”, answered manually from the journal today).
- [ ] Realistic execution from chapter 56 (partial fills, market impact)
  integrated into the paper pipeline.
- [ ] Binance WebSocket, reconnection, rate limiting and stale-data
  detection (chapter 26.2/27) — planned in
  `docs/en/developers/live-trading-roadmap.md`.
- [ ] Spot testnet (chapter 68) — and only then consider real money.
